<p class="drop-cap">THE scene is Wilfrid Bertram’s
rooms in Piccadilly,
facing the Green Park. The
time is six o’clock in the afternoon.
The audience is a goodly
number of men and women of
that class which calls itself
Society. The rooms are small
and the guests are many.
A few look contemptuously
amused. A great many appear
excruciatingly bored.</p>

<p>“It’s all rot!” says one
gentleman in confidence to his
walking-stick.</p>

<p>It is the general opinion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
though it has but one spokesman.</p>

<p>“What a shame, when he is
so much in earnest!” says a
pretty girl.</p>

<p>“Bores always are awfully
in earnest,” replies the critic.
“If he’d only give us something
to drink——”</p>

<p>“You can get plenty to
drink in the street,” says the
young lady, with a withering
glance.</p>

<p>Meantime, Wilfrid Bertram,
who has been speaking for more
than an hour without contradiction,
except such as he read
on his friends’ faces, perceives
at last that he has been wearying
them; a knowledge which
is always slow to steal upon the
teacher of mankind.</p>

<p>He stops in the middle of a
very fine peroration.</p>

<p>“My dear people,” he remarks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
a little irritably—“I
mean, ladies and gentlemen—if
you are so soon weary of so illimitable
a subject, I fear I must
have failed to do it justice.”</p>

<p>“So soon?—oh, hang it!”
says the man who has wished
for something to drink. “We
came upstairs at half-past four,
and you’ve had all the jaw to
yourself ever since, and it’s past
six now, and we’re all as thirsty
as dogs.”</p>

<p>An expression of extreme
disdain passes over the lecturer’s
face.</p>

<p>“I did not invite <i>you</i>, Lord
Marlow,” he says, very coldly.
“If I had done I would have
provided beer and skittles for
your entertainment.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I say Wilfrid, come,
finish your address to us; it’s
extremely interesting,” observes,
in amiable haste, a much older<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
man, with a bald head and
pleasant, ruddy countenance,
who is his uncle, Lord Southwold.</p>

<p>“Immensely interesting!”
echo everybody: they can say
so with animation, almost with
veracity, now that they are
aware it is drawing to an end.</p>

<p>“I ask your pardon if my
infirmities have done injustice
to a noble theme. I fear
I have failed to make myself
intelligible,” says Bertram,
in a tone intended to be
apologetic, but which is actually
only aggressive, since it plainly
implies that his pearls have
been thrown before swine. He
closes the manuscript and note-books
which are lying before
him with the air of a person who
is prepared for anything from
the obtuseness and ingratitude
of humanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>“Nothing could be clearer
than what you’ve said,” says
the gentleman who wanted a
drink. “Nobody is to have
anything they can call their
own, and everybody who likes
is to eat in one’s plate and
bathe in one’s bath.”</p>

<p>“At theatres the buffoon in
the gallery is usually turned out,
with the approval of the entire
audience,” Bertram remarks,
with sententious chilliness.
“Were I not in my own chambers——”</p>

<p>Lord Marlow laughs rudely.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you could
throw me downstairs. Your
diet of brown bread and asparagus
don’t make muscle.”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow—before
women—pray be quiet,” murmurs
a guardsman who is on
the seat next to him.</p>

<p>“Do finish your reading,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
Wilfrid,” says Lady Southwold,
coaxingly. “Your views
are so disinterested if they are
a—a—a little difficult to carry
out as the world is constituted.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” replies Bertram,
“I have trespassed too
long on every one’s indulgence.
It is, I believe, altogether impossible
to attempt to introduce
altruism and duty into a society
which considers Lord Marlow’s
type of humanity as either
wholesome or ornamental.”</p>

<p>“I never knew a lecture that
didn’t end in a free fight,” says
his uncle Southwold, hurriedly.
“But we can’t have one here,
Wilfrid, there are too many
ladies present.”</p>

<p>A shabby little old gentleman,
doubled up in his chair,
who is his grace of Bridlington,
murmurs doubtfully: “I don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
see how your theories would
work, Bertram.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you, Duke? Is
there not such a proverb as
<i>Fais ce que dois, advienne que
pourra</i>?”</p>

<p>The duke nods, and coughs.
“There is. But I am afraid it
will land you in Queer Street
sometimes. There’s another old
saw, you know, ‘Look before
you leap!’ Safer of the two,
eh?”</p>

<p>“For the selfish, no doubt,”
replies Bertram.</p>

<p>His hand is on his note-book;
he is thinking with regret of
the concluding passages which
he has not been able to read,
and a little also that Cicely Seymour,
the young lady who
snubs Marlow, has a very beautiful
profile, as a white gauze
hat laden with white lilac rests
on the fair coils of her hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>That brute Marlow is at her
elbow, saying something idiotic;
Bertram cannot hear what, but
he hears her laugh, and knows
that she is probably being made
to laugh at himself.</p>

<p>The intruding Marlow’s jeer
at his vegetarian views is unjust
to him, for he is tall and
well made, though slender; but
then, as his people often tell
him, his muscle was built up
in the score of unregenerate
years before his Oxford terms,
when he was as philistine as
any other Eton boy, though he
liked his books better than the
playing-fields.</p>

<p>He is the younger son of a
peer, has a little money of his
own, and makes a little more by
writing for scholarly reviews;
but beyond all he is an altruist,
a collectivist, a Fourrierist, an
Engelist, a Tolstoi-ist; and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
in common with other theorists,
he has imagined that to be told
the truth is enough to make
people believe in it and observe
its gospel. He has been continually
deceived in this impression;
but he has always
held it, and it is proportionately
irritating to him when, after
having shed the light of information
upon his contemporaries,
they still show no symptoms of
being converted.</p>

<p>Even the old duke, who is
his godfather, and is generally
tender to his theories, does nothing
but nod his head and
repeat like a magpie: “Look
before you leap!”</p>

<p>“I think you said that property
was like a cancer in the
body politic?” observes a lover
of practical politics, a Unionist
member of parliament, putting
his glass in his eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>“I said the consolidation and
transmission of property was
so,” replies Bertram, with some
hauteur: people cannot even
quote him correctly!</p>

<p>“Ah! seems to me the same
thing.”</p>

<p>“No more the same thing
than Seltzer and the Sellinger!”
cries Marlow.</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed,” says the politician,
humbly; “forgive my
stupidity.”</p>

<p>Bertram implies by a gesture
that his indulgence to human
imbecility is inexhaustible, but
sorely tried.</p>

<p>“I had hoped,” he says, sententiously,
“that you would
have gathered from my previous
discourse how intense is my
conviction that those who possess
property should give it up,
generously, spontaneously, for
the good of all, before awaiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
that inevitable retribution which
will fall on them if they continue
to insult the People by
their display of wealth, unearned
and unjustified; for the riches
of the noble and the millionaire
are as absolutely theft as any
stolen goods obtained by violence
and fraud, and do continually
provoke the crimes which
they so savagely denounce and
punish——”</p>

<p>“Humph! That’s strong,”
mutters the duke.</p>

<p>“La Propriété c’est le vol,”
murmurs Cicely Seymour
“La propriété d’autrui, oui;
mais pas la mienne!”</p>

<p>“If there’s no flimsy anywhere,”
asks Lord Marlow,
“who’ll breed racers?”</p>

<p>“Who’ll buy Comet clarets?”</p>

<p>“Who’ll employ cooks?”</p>

<p>“Who’ll keep up shootin’?”</p>

<p>“Who’ll build <i>Valkyries</i>?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>“Who’ll go by the Flying
Dutchman?”</p>

<p>“Who’ll dance cotillons?”</p>

<p>Bertram replies with dignity:
“My friends, these are mere
frivolous jests on your part.
When the entire structure of
our rotten and debased society
shall have been shattered there
will of course be no place in
a regenerate world for these
mere foolish egotisms.”</p>

<p>“Foolish egotisms!” echoes
Lord Southwold. “Oh, Lord!
A good glass of wine a foolish
egotism?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean you want
Local Option?” asks the duke,
with some alarm. “I wouldn’t
have come if I’d known that.”</p>

<p>Bertram answers with irritation;
“There is no question
of local option or of total abstinence,
Duke. If property were
generally and duly distributed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
wine would be so too; and if
individualism were duly recognised,
you would no more dare
to interfere with the drunkard
than with the genius.”</p>

<p>“African sherry all round—what
a millennium!” cries
his uncle. “Tipplers all over
the place, and no lock-up to put
’em in! What an Arcadia!”</p>

<p>“Genius has frequently been
rudely compared to inebriety,”
remarks the practical politician;
“but I have never known quite
such a slap in the face given
to it as this. Max Nardau is
deferential in comparison.”</p>

<p>“Look, sir,” says Bertram,
addressing the duke, but glancing
at Cicely Seymour—“look
at the utter debasement of our
financial system! What are
banks except incentives to
crime? What are the Bourses,
the Exchanges, or Wall Street,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
except large seething cauldrons
of sin? What are the great
speculating companies if not
banded thieves for the stripping
of a gullible public? What is
the watch you wear, with its
visible chain glaring across your
waistcoat, except a base, mean,
grinning mockery of the hungry
man who meets you in the
street?”</p>

<p>Marlow takes out his watch.</p>

<p>“My conscience is clear in
that respect. My watch is a
Waterbury, and wouldn’t fetch
the hungry man a shilling if he
pawned it.”</p>

<p>“And my chain,” says Lord
Southwold, touching a steel one,
“was my poor old Hector’s
collar, and I wear it in memory
of him. How he’d thresh out
five acres of turnips before luncheon!
We shall never see his
like.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>Bertram grows impatient:
“Individually you may wear
Waterburys or dog-collars, but
each is nevertheless a symbol
of inequality between you and
the man in the street, who is
obliged to look at the church
clock to see the hour at which
he may seek the parish dole.”</p>

<p>“What profound philosophy!”
cries Southwold.
“What crimes one may commit
without knowing it!”</p>

<p>“If a watch be an unwholesome
sign of a bloated aristocracy,
pray, Mr. Bertram, what
are our jewels?” asks a very
pretty woman, Lady Jane
Rivaux.</p>

<p>“There are no words strong
enough,” replies Bertram, “to
condemn the use of gems,
whether from a moral or an
æsthetic point of view. In a
purified condition of society<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
they would of course become
impossible abominations.”</p>

<p>The ladies present are too
horrified to speak; Jane Rivaux,
alone, recovering her first shock
of surprise at such a blasphemy,
asks, with vivacity:</p>

<p>“But all the people you would
throw out of employment?
The people who dig for jewels,
don’t they dig? The people
who polish them, and cut them,
and set them, and deal in them;
the people who make the iron
safes, and the patent locks, you
would throw them all out of
work? Surely that wouldn’t be
doing any good? What would
become of the miners and lapidaries
and jewellers and all the
rest?”</p>

<p>Bertram smiles with pitying
disdain.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear Lady Jane,
your kind of reasoning is as old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
as the hills, and carries its own
refutation with it. All those
workmen and tradesmen would
be liberated from labours which
now degrade them, and would
thus be set free for higher work—work
worthy of being illumined
by the light of reason.”</p>

<p>“What work? Would they
be all schoolmasters and governesses?
Or all authors and
artists?”</p>

<p>“What work? Such work
as the Community might
organise and distribute, such
work as might be needful
for the general good. When
every one will work, every
one will have leisure. The
poet will mow the meadow in
the morning and compose his
eclogues in the afternoon. The
painter will fell trees at dawn
and at noon paint his landscapes
in the forest. The sculptor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
will hew coal in the bowels of
the earth for a few hours and
come to the upper air to carve
the marble and mould the clay.
The author will guide the
plough or plant the potato-patch
at sunrise and will have
the rest of the day free to
write his novel or study his
essay——”</p>

<p>“Humph!” says Southwold,
ruffling his short grey hair in
perplexity. “The precise use
of wasting Sir Frederic
Leighton’s time on a seam
of coal, and Mr. Swinburne’s
on a mowing machine, I
don’t exactly perceive. However——”</p>

<p>“Pierre Loti is your ideal,
then,” says Cicely Seymour.
“He ‘has gone down to the
deep in ships’ before he writes
of sea life.”</p>

<p>“He is an officer,” objects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
Bertram, with regret and condemnation
in his tone. “With
his true and profound altruism
he should have gone before the
mast.”</p>

<p>“I suppose our sex will have
to sweep and cook and sew
before we are allowed to
frolic?” asks Lady Jane.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to produce a
certificate that you have made
and baked three dozen pigeon
pies before you’ll be allowed one
waltz, Lady Jane,” says Marlow,
who has with difficulty kept
his mouth shut.</p>

<p>“We shall sweep our own
chimneys, clean ourselves, and
play the violin,” replies that
lively person. “We shall have
to cook our salmon before
we’re allowed to fish for it; we
shall have to roast our pheasants
before we’re allowed to shoot
them, and——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>Bertram interrupts her with
scant courtesy: “I understood
that those who did
me the honour to come here
to-day brought open minds
and philosophical views to
this meeting, or I should not
have invited you to discuss and
consider the best means for the
educated classes to anticipate
the coming changes of the
world.”</p>

<p>“Why should we anticipate
them,” murmurs the old duke,
“when they’ll be so deucedly
uncomfortable to all of us?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” says Southwold,
“it’ll be bad enough to
grin and bear’em.”</p>

<p>Bertram plays wearily with
his shut note-book.</p>

<p>“If you cannot see the
theoretic beauty of united and
universal work, it is hopeless to
expect that you should desire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
its practical adjustment to everyday
life.”</p>

<p>“Well, but,” says the politician,
who is nothing if not
practical, “it is just the utter
unworkableness of your system
which damns it in the eyes of
rational men. Pardon my saying
so.”</p>

<p>Lady Southwold murmurs:
“Give them some tea, Wilfrid;
they are all growing cross.”</p>

<p>“As you please. But it is to
me absolutely frightful to see
how unconscious of your own
doom, and how indifferent to
the great movements of the day
you all are——”</p>

<p>“If they are really great
movements, they’ll move without
us; you can’t stop an iceberg
or an earthquake with
your little finger. But there’s
a good deal of grit in the old
order of things still,” says the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
duke. “Yes, I’ll have a cup of
tea, Wilfrid; I see you’ve got
it there.”</p>

<p>Bertram murmurs wearily:
“Critchett—tea!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” says a person
who is the perfection of all
the virtues of valetdom.</p>

<p>Marlow, wholly undisturbed
by the insults which have been
heaped on him, calls out:</p>

<p>“And temperance drinks,
Critchett! Lemons divorced
from rum, sterilised milk,
barley-water, tartaric acid——”</p>

<p>“Mr. Bertram,” says Cicely
Seymour, “how do you reconcile
your conscience to the debasing
offices which you employ
Critchett to fill for you?”</p>

<p>“Or to the fact of keeping
a Critchett at all?” adds his
aunt Southwold.</p>

<p>“Surely it’s Critchett who
keeps him, ——, out of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
strait-waistcoat?” murmurs
Marlow.</p>

<p>Critchett hands tea and coffee
and chocolate, in a silver service,
with cakes, fruits, and
biscuits.</p>

<p>“And all these pretty things,
Mr. Bertram?” asks Lady
Jane. “Surely they are the
flesh-pots of Egypt, and ought
not to be here?”</p>

<p>“They ought not,” replies
Bertram, “nor Critchett either.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he is such a delightful
servant; so noiseless, so <i>prévenant</i>,
and so devoted to you;
you would never find his equal
if you sent him away.”</p>

<p>“No; but for one man to
serve another is contrary to all
principles of self-respect on
either side.”</p>

<p>“My dear Wilfrid,” cries
Lady Southwold, “how I wish
you were small enough to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
whipped! What a deal of
good it would do you!”</p>

<p>Bertram smiles faintly.</p>

<p>“Flagellation was, I believe,
most admirable discipline; but
we have grown too effete for it.
Our bodies are as tender as our
hearts are hard.”</p>

<p>“I have always thought,”
said Cicely Seymour, in a very
soft voice, “that if everybody
could be born with ten thousand
a year, nobody would ever do
anything wrong.”</p>

<p>Bertram looks at her approvingly.
“You are on the right road,
Miss Seymour. But as we cannot
generalise property, we
must generalise poverty. The
result will be equally good.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” roars his
uncle very loudly. “I never
heard such a subversive and immoral
doctrine in all my days!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>Bertram glances pityingly at
him.</p>

<p>“And yet it is based on precisely
the same theory as the one
which you accepted when you
passed the Compulsory Clause
of the Parish Councils Bill.”</p>

<p>“The Upper House passed
that infamous Bill. I was in
the minority against it,” replies
Southwold, very angrily.</p>

<p>“But when everybody’s got
sixpence a day,” suggests a
young man with an ingenuous
countenance, “and nobody sixpence
halfpenny, surely somebody’ll
have a try for the illegal
halfpenny, won’t they? It is
human nature.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” replies Bertram,
very positively. “Nobody
will even wish for an extra
halfpenny, because when inequality
shall be at an end envy
and discontent will be unknown.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
Besides, if all the property of
the world was confiscated or
realised and equally distributed,
the individual portion would
come more nearly to half a
crown a head per diem. On
half a crown a head per diem
any one can live——”</p>

<p>Lord Southwold sighs.
“Oysters are three shillings
a dozen,” he murmurs.</p>

<p>“Of course, if you expect to
continue the indulgence of an
epicure’s diseased appetites——”
says Bertram, with impatience.</p>

<p>“It’s the oysters that are
diseased, not our appetites,”
says Southwold, with a second
sigh.</p>

<p>“If,” says Bertram, ignoring
his uncle’s nonsense—“if I
have made anything clear in
my recent remarks it must
surely be that Property is,
in the old copy-book phrase,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
the root of all evil; the mandrake
growing out of the bodies
of the dead, the poisonous gas
exhaling from the carrion of
prejudice, of injustice, and of
caste.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear Wilfrid,” cries
Lady Southwold, with equal
impatience, “yours is rank
Communism.”</p>

<p>“You can call it what you
please. It is the only condition
of things which would accompany
pure civilisation. When,
however, I speak of half a
crown a day,” he pursues, “I
use a figure of speech! Of
course, in a purely free world
there would be no coined or
printed money, there would be
only barter.”</p>

<p>“Barter!” echoes Marlow.
“I should carry two of my
Berkshire pigs, one under each
arm, and exchange them with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
you for a thousand copies of
your <i>Age to Come</i>.”</p>

<p>“I think barter would be inconvenient,
Mr. Bertram,” says
Cicely Seymour, doubtfully.
“And what should I barter? I
can’t make anything. I should
have to cut off my hair and
wait a year till it grew again.”</p>

<p>Every one laughs, and Bertram
even relaxes his gravity.</p>

<p>“I fear, Miss Seymour, that
Solon’s self would give you all
you wished for a single smile!”</p>

<p>At that moment a small boy
comes into the room, out of
breath, grinning, with several
oblong pieces of printed paper
in his hand; he pushes his way
unconcerned between the ladies
and gentlemen, and thrusts the
papers at Bertram.</p>

<p>“Here, mister, you must
tone these here down; manager
says as Fanshawe says as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
British Public wouldn’t never
stand them pars. he’s marked at
no time; and manager says as
I was to tell you Public is extra
nervous now cos o’ that bomb
at Tooting.”</p>

<p>Bertram takes the sheets in ill
humour, and tears them across.</p>

<p>“Mr. Fanshawe is well aware
that I never correct and I never
suppress. I forbid the production
of the article in a mutilated
state.” He hands the pieces to
the boy. “Bid Mr. Fanshawe
return me my original copy.”</p>

<p>The boy looks frightened.</p>

<p>“Who’ll pay for this here
settin’-up, sir, please, if proof
ain’t to be used?”</p>

<p>“Did you say Fanshawe?”
says Lord Southwold. “Do
you mean the great Fanshawe
of the <i>Torch</i>? Can anything
be possibly too strong for
him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>“Oh, my dear Wilfred! do
let us hear what you can
have said? It must be something
terrific!” says the old
duke, who rather likes subversive
opinions, considering
philosophically that he will be
in his grave before they can
possibly be put into practice.</p>

<p>“What ’m I to tell the
manager about payin’ for the
settin’-up of this here, if type’s
to be broke up, sir?” asks the
boy, with dogged persistence.</p>

<p>“Go out of the room, you
impudent little rascal!” says
Bertram, in extreme irritation.
“Critchett! turn that boy
out!”</p>

<p>Marlow gets up and offers
the boy a plate of pound cake.</p>

<p>“You are not civil to your
sooty Mercury, Bertram. He
offers you at this moment the
most opportune illustration of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
your theories. He comes on
an errand of the intellect, and
if a somewhat soiled messenger,
he should nevertheless be treated
with the respect due to a
guardian of literary purity and
public morality. Sweet imp!
refresh your inner man!”</p>

<p>The boy stuffs his mouth
with cake and grins.</p>

<p>“Are these chambers mine or
yours, Lord Marlow?” asks
Bertram.</p>

<p>“Both mine and yours, or
neither yours or mine. There
is no such thing as exclusive
possession. You have just told
us so.”</p>

<p>“Critchett!” says Bertram,
and points with stony gaze to
the printer’s devil, “turn that
boy out of the room.”</p>

<p>Critchett, reluctantly touching
anything so sooty, takes
him by the collar and drives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
him before him out of the
room.</p>

<p>Marlow picks up the torn
proofs. “Who’ll pay for the
setting-up? asks this dear child.
Unused proofs are, I suppose,
first cousins to spilt milk and
spoilt powder. Mayn’t we read
this article? The title is
immensely suggestive—‘Fist-right
and Brain-divinity.’ Are
you feloniously sympathetic
with the Tooting bomb?”</p>

<p>Bertram takes the torn proofs
from him in irritation and
throws them into the open
drawer of a cabinet.</p>

<p>“The essay is addressed to
persons of intelligence and
with principle,” he says, significantly.</p>

<p>“But it seems that Fanshawe
has neither, if he fail to appreciate
it?”</p>

<p>“Fanshawe has both; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
there are occasional moments
in which he recollects that he
has some subscribers in Philistia.”</p>

<p>“Fanshawe knows where his
bread is buttered,” chuckles the
duke; “knows where his bread
is buttered.”</p>

<p>“If Fanshawe don’t publish
it he won’t pay for it, will
he?” asks Marlow, with some
want of tact.</p>

<p>“I do not take payment for
opinions,” replies Bertram, <i>au
bout des lèvres</i>, and much annoyed
at the turn the conversation
has taken.</p>

<p>“Most people run opinions
in order to get paid for ’em,”
says the duke, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>“Why are you not in Parliament,
Mr. Bertram?” asks
Cicely Seymour.</p>

<p>“In Parliament!” repeats
Bertram, with the faintness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
horror; incredulous that he
can hear aright.</p>

<p>“Well, yes; have I said anything
so very dreadful?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear Cicely!” says
Lady Southwold. “Ever since
Wilfrid came of age we have
all been at him about that; he
might have had a walk over for
Sax-Stoneham, or for Micklethorpe,
at any election, but he
would never even let himself be
nominated.”</p>

<p>Bertram shrugs his shoulders
in ineffable disgust.</p>

<p>“Two Tory boroughs!”</p>

<p>“You could have held any
opinions you had chosen.
Toryism is a <i>crépon changeant</i>
nowadays; it looks exactly like
Radicalism very often, and only
differs from it in being still
more outrageous.”</p>

<p>“But perhaps Mr. Bertram’s
objection is to all representative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
government?” says Cicely
Seymour.</p>

<p>Bertram glances gratefully
at her. “Precisely so, Miss
Seymour.”</p>

<p>“But what could you substitute?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear Cicely, read
his paper the <i>Age to Come</i>,
and pray spare us such a discussion
before dinner,” says
Lady Southwold, with impatience.</p>

<p>“But what would you substitute?”
says Cicely Seymour,
with persistent interest in the
topic.</p>

<p>“Yes; what would you substitute?”
asks the practical
politician.</p>

<p>Bertram is out of temper;
these acquaintances and relatives
worried him into giving this
exposition of his altruistic and
socialistic views, and then they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
brought a fool with them like
Marlow, and have turned the
whole thing into a farce. To
Bertram his views were the
most serious things in creation.
He does not choose to have
them set up like croquet pegs
for imbeciles to bowl at in an
idle hour.</p>

<p>“I would abolish <i>all</i> government,”
he replies, very decidedly.</p>

<p>“Oh!” Both the politician
and Cicely Seymour look a
little astonished.</p>

<p>“But how then would you
control people?”</p>

<p>“Sane people do not require
to be controlled.”</p>

<p>“But I have heard a man of
science say that only one person
out of every hundred is really
sane?”</p>

<p>“We are bad judges of each
other’s sanity. But since you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
take an interest in serious subjects,”
says Bertram, resting his
eyes on her in approval, “I
will, if you will allow me, send
you some back numbers of
the <i>Age to Come</i>.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean, Wilfrid,
that an obtuse world is so ungrateful
as to leave you any
back numbers at all?” asks
Southwold.</p>

<p>“They will show you,” continues
Bertram, ignoring the
interruption, “what my views
and the views of those who
think with me are, concerning
the best method of preparing
the world to meet those social
changes which are inevitable
for the future, those rights of
the individual which are totally
ignored and outraged by all
present governments, whether
absolute, constitutional, or, in
nomenclature, republican.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>“But why should we prepare
to meet them when they’ll
be so deucedly uncomfortable
to us if they arrive, and why
should we trouble about helping
them onward if they’re so
inevitable and cocksure in their
descent on us?” says his uncle.</p>

<p>“I asked you that question just
now, and you didn’t answer me.
Does one avoid an avalanche
in the Alps by firing a gun
to make it fall sooner than it
would do if left alone?”</p>

<p>Critchett is meantime engaged
on the expulsion of the
printer’s devil by a back-stair
exit, and, profiting by his absence,
a little girl, who has come
in at the front entrance, pushes
aside the <i>portière</i> of the door
and stands abashed in the
middle of the room. She is
eight years old, has a head of
red hair, and the shrewd, watching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
face of the London child;
she carries a penny bunch of
violets. Bertram sees her entrance
with extreme displeasure,
not unmixed with embarrassment.</p>

<p>“What do you want here,
Bessy?” he inquires, with scant
amiability.</p>

<p>Bessy advances and holds out
the violets.</p>

<p>“Annie sends these ’ere
vi’lets with her love, and she’s
got to go to Ealin’ for a big
border o’ mustard an’ cress, and
please when’ll you be round at
our place?”</p>

<p>Bertram is extremely annoyed.</p>

<p>“Run away, my good child.
You see I am engaged.”</p>

<p>“When’ll you be round at
our place?” repeats the little
girl. “The pal as lodges over
cousin Joe hev given us tickets
for Hoxton Theayter, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
Annie says as how she’d go
if you wasn’t comin’ in this
evenin’.”</p>

<p>“Run away, child,” repeats
Bertram, imperiously. “Critchett!”</p>

<p>Critchett, who has returned,
with a demure smile, guides
the steps of the reluctant Bessy
from the chamber.</p>

<p>“Why do you let these
children in, Critchett?” asks
Bertram, as the valet returns.</p>

<p>“I beg pardon, sir,” the servant
says, humbly, as he lays
the violets down on a <i>cloisonné</i>
plate. “But you have
told me, sir, that you are
always at home for the Brown
family.”</p>

<p>“You might surely have
more judgment, after all your
years of service!” replies his
master. “There are exceptions
to every rule.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>Marlow looks up to the ceiling
in scandalised protest.</p>

<p>“Service! Service!” he repeats.
“Hear him, ye gods!
This is the rights of the
individual; the independence
of the unit; the perfect equality
of one human being before
another!”</p>

<p>Cicely Seymour looks over
her shoulder at him and remarks
slightingly: “You are
a great tease, Lord Marlow.
You make me think I am in
the schoolroom at Alfreton
with my brothers home from
Eton for Christmas. Do you
really think that chaff is wit?”</p>

<p>“I am not chaffing, Miss
Seymour. I am in deadly
earnest. This modest bunch
must hold a deal of meaning.
Who are the Brown family?
Where is ‘our place’? What
is the meeting which must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
postponed because a bloated
aristocrat, rolling in ill-gotten
wealth, requires that corrupting
luxury known as mustard and
cress?”</p>

<p>Everybody laughs, except
Cicely Seymour.</p>

<p>“Yes, Wilfrid,” says Lady
Southwold; “who are the
Brown family?”</p>

<p>“To whom you are always
at home,” adds his uncle.</p>

<p>“And Annie who sends
button-holes with love,” adds
Marlow.</p>

<p>Bertram replies with icy
brevity, “A perfectly respectable
young woman.”</p>

<p>“And the respectable one’s
address?” asks Marlow.
“Where is ‘our place’? I
am seized with an irresistible
longing to eat mustard and
cress. I never did eat it, but
still——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>Bertram eyes him very disagreeably.
“The Browns are
persons I esteem. I should not
give their address to persons
for whom I have no esteem.”</p>

<p>“My dear Wilfrid!” cries
his aunt. “How altruism does
sour the temper!”</p>

<p>“Temper! I hope I have
too much philosophy to allow
my temper to be ruffled by the
clumsy horse-jokes of my acquaintances.”</p>

<p>“But why are you always at
home to these Browns?”</p>

<p>Bertram hesitates.</p>

<p>“Are they acolytes? studies?
pensioners?” asks his aunt.</p>

<p>“Is the respectable one
pretty?” murmurs Marlow.
“The respectable ones so
uncommonly rarely are!”</p>

<p>He takes the violets off the
<i>cloisonné</i> plate.</p>

<p>“A buttonhole to be worn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
at Hoxton Theatre? It is an
emblem of the immorality of
finance: for its commercial value
must be at least four farthings.
If my Waterbury offend the
eye of eternal justice this penny
bunch must outrage it no
less.”</p>

<p>“It is quite natural, I think,”
says Cicely Seymour, rather
impatiently, “that Mr. Bertram
should have many friends in
those classes which he considers
so superior to his own.”</p>

<p>“I do not say any class is
superior to any other,” interrupts
Bertram. “I say that
all are equal.”</p>

<p>There is now a great buzz
of voices everywhere in the
rooms; people are so very glad
to have the muzzle off after an
hour’s silence; he cannot doubt,
as that murmur and trill of
conversation run all round him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
that he has bored them all
excruciatingly.</p>

<p>“They have no minds!” he
thinks, bitterly. “We sell a
bare score of copies a month
of the <i>Age to Come</i>, and the
<i>Dustcart</i>, with its beastly ribaldry
and social scandals, sells
sixty-five thousand!”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say,
Wilfrid,” asks his aunt, eating
a caviare sandwich, “that anybody
would pay taxes if they
were not obliged?”</p>

<p>“Do not people, urged by
conscience, send arrears, unasked,
to the Chancellor of the
Exchequer?”</p>

<p>“Well, they do certainly
now and then. But they must be
very oddly constituted people.”</p>

<p>“Is conscience an eccentricity?”</p>

<p>His aunt does not argue, she
only shakes her head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>“I can’t believe anybody
would pay taxes if they weren’t
obliged.”</p>

<p>“But they do. There are
these instances in the papers.
If moral feeling in the public
were acute and universal, as it
ought to be, every public duty
would be fulfilled with promptitude
and without pressure.”</p>

<p>The old duke nods very
expressively.</p>

<p>“Your aunt’s right,” he
mumbles. “Conscience-money
can only come from cranks!”</p>

<p>“Come and dine with us,
Wilfrid,” says his aunt; “we
never see you now. I assure
you a good dinner changes the
colour of political opinions in
a wonderful degree. I am
dreadfully afraid that you have
been living on boiled soles and
carrot fritters.”</p>

<p>Bertram smiles slightly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
“The carrot fritters; not the
soles. I am a vegetarian.”</p>

<p>“But we are justified in
being carnivorous,” says Southwold,
very eagerly. “Individualism
justifies us.”</p>

<p>Marlow repeats with emphasis:
“We are justified in
being carnivorous. Individualism
justifies us.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” says Bertram,
with uncivil sarcasm. “The
crocodile has a right to its
appetites, and the cur to its
vomit. Solomon said so.”</p>

<p>“Am I the crocodile or the
cur?” asks Southwold.</p>

<p>“Do you keep Critchett on
carrot fritters?” asks Marlow,
“and what does he have to
drink? Hot water? Hot
water is, I believe, the beverege
which nowadays accompanies
high thinking.”</p>

<p>“And how do you reconcile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
your conscience and your creeds
to keeping a Critchett at all?”
repeats Lady Jane.</p>

<p>Bertram replies with distant
chillness and proud humility:
“The leaven of long habit is
hard to get rid of; I entirely
agree with you that I am in
the wrong. To have a servant
at all is an offence to
humanity; it is an impertinence
to the brotherhood of
our common mortality.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid,” says
Southwold, grimly, “our brothers
and sisters in the servants’
halls pay us out for the outrage;
they take away our
characters, read our correspondence,
and pocket twenty per
cent. on all our bills.”</p>

<p>“Can you blame them?
They are the product of a
corrupt society. No one can
blame them, whatever they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
or do. The dunghill cannot
bring forth the rose. Your
service has debased them.
The fault of their debasement
lies with you.”</p>

<p>“But Critchett cannot be
debased. He must, living in
so rarefied a moral atmosphere,
be elevated above all
mortal weaknesses.”</p>

<p>Bertram replies stiffly: “I
can assure you I have much
more respect for Critchett than
for any member of a St. James’
Street club.”</p>

<p>“And yet you give him
carrot fritters!” cried Lady
Southwold.</p>

<p>Bertram replies with great
irritation: “He eats whatever
he pleases, turtle and turbot for
aught I know. I should never
presume to impose upon him
either my menu or my tenets,
my beliefs or my principles.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>“You do wisely if you wish
to keep him!” says his aunt.
“I hope you <i>will</i> keep him.
He is your only link with
civilised life.”</p>

<p>Bertram smiles. “My dear
aunt, when I was in the
South Pacific I landed at a
small island where civilisation
was considered to consist in a
pierced nose and a swollen belly.
I do not want to be offensive,
but the estimate which my age
takes of its own civilisation is
not very much more sensible.”</p>

<p>“I think it would have
been better, Wilfrid, to study
psychology under these savages
than to publish the <i>Age to
Come</i>! You could not have
injured <i>them</i>, but here——”</p>

<p>“How illiberal you are, dear
Lady Southwold,” says Cicely
Seymour. “You want a course
of Montaigne.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“What’s that, Miss Seymour?”
asks Marlow. “A
rival to Mariani wine?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a French wine; very
old and quite unequalled!”</p>

<p>Even Bertram laughs. Marlow
is irritated. He does not
see what he has said which is
so absurd, or why his friends
are laughing.</p>

<p>“Why do you always take
that prig’s part?” he mutters,
sullenly, aside to Cicely Seymour.</p>

<p>“I do not take any one’s
part,” replies the young lady;
“but I detest injustice and
illiberality.”</p>

<p>At this moment the old
duke rises with Bertram’s help,
is assisted by him to find his
hat and stick, and takes his
departure, assuring his godson
that he had been much entertained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>Following the duke’s example
every one takes their
leave, assuring their instructor
that they have derived much
entertainment and information
from his disquisition. Cicely
Seymour says simply and very
gently: “Thanks, Mr. Bertram.
You have made me
your debtor for many noble
thoughts.”</p>

<p>When they have left him
Bertram walks up and down
his rooms dissatisfied with
himself.</p>

<p>“What a coward!” he
thinks, with the moral self-flagellation
of an over-sensitive
and over-sincere person.
“Why could I not tell them
the truth? Why did I limit
myself to saying that she was
a perfectly respectable young
woman? If I cannot face the
simple enunciation of the intention,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
how shall I ever bring
myself to the endurance of
publishing the fact when it is
accomplished? Am I, after all,
the slave of opinion, like anybody
else? Am I afraid of a
set of fools who are capering
on their primrose path, seeing
nothing of the abyss to which
it leads? If I have not the
courage of my views and
faiths, wherein am I superior
to their philistinism? I do
what I choose; what I see to
be wise and right and just; I
desire to give an example
which shall show how utterly
I despise the fictitious barriers
of caste and custom, and yet
I have not courage enough to
say to a few people who are
drinking tea in my rooms,
‘My good folks, I am going
to marry a young woman
called Annie Brown.’ Why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
could I not say it? Why was
I such a miserable poltroon?”</p>

<p>He throws himself into a
deep chair and lights a cigarette.</p>

<p>“What would my aunt have
done? What would that grinning
cad Marlow have said?
What would Cicely Seymour
have thought? Perhaps she
would have approved. She
has more sympathy, more insight
than the others—and
what a charming profile! And
those deep blue eyes under
those long thick lashes; they
are eyes which have mind in
them as well as youth and
smiles and innocence; they are
eyes which will be still beautiful
when she is seventy and
her hair is white under a lace
mob-cap or a black satin hood.
What colour are Annie’s eyes?
They are round and small, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
no particular colour, I think;
a reddish grey. Dear good
little girl, it was not for her
beauty that I selected her.”</p>

<p>Critchett opens the door at
that moment, and breaks in on
his reflections.</p>

<p>“Mr. Fanshawe, sir.”</p>

<p>A gentleman of no definite
age, with a shrewd countenance
and a significant smile, crosses
the room with outstretched
hand.</p>

<p>“My dear Wilfrid, they tell
me you are in a wax about the
exceptions I took to your article.
I am extremely sorry to touch
any single line of yours, but
B.P. must be considered, you
know. You are miles too
advanced for this inviolate isle;
she is still shuddering at the
fright which Guy Fawkes gave
her.”</p>

<p>Bertram replies stiffly: “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
have certainly no affinity to
Guy Fawkes, who was a religious
person and a strict
monarchist. As for the essay,
pray do not trouble yourself;
I shall publish it in the <i>Age to
Come</i>.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s a pity; that
will be practically putting it
into the waste-paper basket; excuse
me saying so, but you
know the circulation of the
<i>Age to Come</i> is at present—is—well—limited.”</p>

<p>“We certainly do not chronicle
scandals of the hunting-field,
and devote columns to
prophesying the shape of next
year’s bonnets, as the <i>Torch</i>
does!”</p>

<p>“That shows you don’t
understand your public, or
don’t want to secure one. Extreme
opinions, my dear boy,
can only be got down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
throats of the world in a
weekly journal by being
adroitly sandwiched between
the caviare of calumny and
the butter of fashion. People
hate to be made to think, my
dear boy. The <i>Age to Come</i>
gives ’em nothing but thinking;
and damned tough thinking
too. You write with uncommon
power, but you are
too wholesale, too subversive;
you scare people so awfully
that they stop their ears to
your truths. That is not the
way to secure a hearing.”</p>

<p>“I am consistent.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord! Never be consistent.
There’s nothing so
unpopular in life.”</p>

<p>“I despise popularity.”</p>

<p>“You despise bread and
butter. I believe you lose
twenty pound a month by
your <i>Age to Come</i>?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“To speak more correctly,”
replies Bertram, bitterly, “it
gets me into debt to that
amount!”</p>

<p>“Heaven and earth! Why
don’t you drop it?”</p>

<p>“It is a matter of principle.”</p>

<p>“Principle which will land
you in Queer Street. Now,
my dear Wilfrid, no man
thinks more things bosh than
I do, or takes more pleasure
in saying so, but I combine
pleasure with business; I say
my say in such a way that it
brings me in eighty per cent.”</p>

<p>Bertram looks at him derisively.</p>

<p>“I have always known that
your intellect was only equalled
by your venality!”</p>

<p>Fanshawe laughs good-humouredly.</p>

<p>“That is neat. That is
soothing. It is not difficult<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
to understand that you are
not considered a clubbable
man! However, as you credit
me with intellect, I don’t mind
your denying me morality. But
seriously, my dear friend, you
are much too violent, too uncompromising
for success in
journalism. Who tries to prove
too much fails to prove anything,
and when you bend your
bow too violently it snaps and
speeds no arrow. I confess that
I (who am as revolutionary as
most people and always disposed
to agree with you) do
frequently get up from the
perusal of one of your articles
with the unwilling conviction
that it is best to let the
old order of things alone.
Now, that is certainly not
the condition of mind which
you wish to produce in your
readers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>Bertram is silent. After a
pause he says:</p>

<p>“What do you advocate,
then? A cautious trimming?”</p>

<p>“Trimming was the name
which the eighteenth-century
politician gave to what we
now call opportunism. All
sagacious men are not opportunists,
but all sagacious men
endeavour to create supporters,
not antagonists. Now, all
violent assertion raises opposition,
for human nature is
cantankerous and contradictory.”</p>

<p>Critchett enters and hands
a card on a salver. “If you
please, sir, the gentleman’s waiting
below; says he sent you a
letter two days ago; gentleman’s
head of the firm of Folliott
and Hake, sir.”</p>

<p>Bertram looks vaguely about
the room. “There are a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
many letters unopened. I
wonder which it is?”</p>

<p>Fanshawe catches up a pile
of letters from a writing-table
and sorts them: “Here’s one
with ‘Folliott and Hake’ on
the seal; how unpractical you
are, dear boy!”</p>

<p>Bertram takes the letter and
looks at it without curiosity.
“It is sure to be something
unpleasant. I never heard of
Folliott and Hake.”</p>

<p>Fanshawe laughs. “I have;
many a time. They have been
solicitors in more than one libel
case, of which the <i>Torch</i> was
defendant. Come, open the
letter. See what it says.”</p>

<p>Bertram opens and reads it:
“Only that they have a matter
of great importance to communicate
to me. I really have
no idea what it can be. People
think so many things important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
which are of infinitesimal insignificance.”</p>

<p>“You will best correct your
ignorance by allowing Mr.
Folliott to enter and explain
himself.”</p>

<p>“I am so opposed to all
lawyers on principle.”</p>

<p>“So am I, as I am opposed
to small-pox, or bicycle riders,
or yellow fogs; but they are
not to be avoided in this life,
and it is neither polite or politic
to keep these highly respectable
solicitors waiting like sweeps.
Critchett, beg Mr. Folliott to
enter. I will leave you, Bertram.”</p>

<p>“No, no; for goodness’ sake
stay. I may want some advice.”</p>

<p>“You not unfrequently do.
But you never follow it when
given. Pray be civil.”</p>

<p>A few moments later Mr.
Folliott enters; a bland, white-haired,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span> 
portly old gentleman, a
little ruffled at having been left
so long at the foot of the
stairs.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Mr.—Mr.—Folliott,”
says Bertram,
looking at the letter. “I had,
in fact, not opened this note of
yours. It is a bad habit I have
of leaving letters unread.”</p>

<p>“It was Sheridan’s, sir,” says
the lawyer, pointedly. “It did
not bring him good fortune.”</p>

<p>He catches sight of Fanshawe,
and his amiable countenance
assumes the startled and
displeased expression of a cat’s
face, when the cat suddenly
perceives a bull terrier.</p>

<p>“I naturally awaited you,
Mr. Bertram, or a communication
from you, all the day,”
he says, in an affronted tone.
“Hearing nothing I thought it
best to come myself. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
are perhaps unaware that the
Prince of Viana is dead.”</p>

<p>“I never heard of the individual,”
says Bertram. “Who
was he?”</p>

<p>“He was your first cousin.
You may know him better as
the son of Mr. Horace Errington.”</p>

<p>“Oh! The son of my
mother’s brother? We never
knew him. There was a family
feud.”</p>

<p>“But you will remember to
have heard that his father made
great wealth in the Abruzzi
through copper mines, was
nationalised, and was ennobled
by Victor Emmanuel. The
family feud was chiefly on account
of his connection with
commerce and his change of
country.”</p>

<p>“Precisely.”</p>

<p>“I regret to inform you that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
your cousin is dead, at thirty-three
years of age, killed by a
wild boar when hunting in the
Pontine marshes; he has left
you, Mr. Bertram, his sole and
exclusive heir.”</p>

<p>Bertram stares at him.</p>

<p>“What! you must be joking,
Mr. Folliott!”</p>

<p>The old gentleman takes off
his gold spectacles and puts them
on again in extreme irritation.</p>

<p>“I am not in the habit of
joking, sir, either in business or
outside it. We were solicitors
to his father and to himself.
We drew up this will five years
ago. You are inheritor of an
immense fortune, Mr. Bertram.”</p>

<p>Bertram stands staring at
him, then turns to Fanshawe.
“Do you hear? Is it true?
Surely, no one could insult me
so greatly, even in jest?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>“I really do not understand,”
says the lawyer, bewildered.
“What insult can
there be? I am speaking, sir,
in most sober earnest.”</p>

<p>“Shall I fan you, Wilfrid?
or send for some sal volatile?”
says Fanshawe, derisively.
“Don’t be an ass,” he adds in
a whisper. “This sensible old
fellow will think it his duty to
shut you up in a private mad-house,
if you talk like that.
Pull yourself together, and
answer him sensibly.”</p>

<p>Mr. Folliott surveys the
speaker as a timid person may
look at a lion riding on a
velocipede in a circus-ring.</p>

<p>“If Mr. Bertram would
place me in communication
with his solicitor matters
would be facilitated,” he murmurs.</p>

<p>“I have no solicitors,” replies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
Bertram. “If you will
pardon what may seem an
offensive opinion, I regard all
men of law as poisonous parasites
growing on the rotten
trunk of a society which has
the axe of retribution laid at its
roots.”</p>

<p>Mr. Folliott is too astonished
to be offended: “I fail to follow
you, sir, but I have no
doubt you mean something
very profound. Your cousin
did not, I imagine, read your
articles in the reviews, but I
have read one or two of them.
However, notwithstanding your
extraordinary opinions, you are
a man of birth and breeding,
and must, in a measure, be a
man of the world, sir. You
must know that you must
allow me to fulfil my office.
This will has to be proved and
probate taken out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>“Where is the necessity?”</p>

<p>“Be so good as not to play
with me. You must accept
the inheritance or decline it.
In event of your refusal, of your
formal and final refusal, the
whole of this property is to go
to the testator’s old college at
Oxford—Magdalen College.”</p>

<p>“Ah! that is a consolation.”</p>

<p>“Why so, sir?”</p>

<p>“Because, although I have
no sympathy with the modern
movements at Oxford, and consider
that she has fallen away
from her original high mission,
yet she is, and always will be,
a seat of learning; and the
Humanities will never wholly
be banished from her halls.”</p>

<p>“Again, I fail to follow you sir.”</p>

<p>“I mean that such an alternative
destination for the property<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
will enable me to decline
it with a clear conscience.”</p>

<p>“Really, sir, your replies are
wholly unintelligible.”</p>

<p>Bertram turns helplessly to
Fanshawe. “Explain to this
gentleman my views regarding
property.”</p>

<p>“I am aware of some of
them, sir,” replies the solicitor,
sententiously.</p>

<p>“You read the <i>Torch</i>, Mr.
Folliott, don’t you?” says the
proprietor of the <i>Torch</i>.</p>

<p>“When my professional
duties compel me, sir.”</p>

<p>“But the <i>Torch</i> is milk for
lambs, Mr. Folliott, beside the
<i>Age to Come</i>.”</p>

<p>The solicitor bows with an
expression which indicates that
he would prefer to remain
unacquainted with the <i>Age to
Come</i>.</p>

<p>“But pardon me,” continues<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
Fanshawe, “is my friend here
really so immensely in luck’s
way?”</p>

<p>“He inherits under the
Prince of Viana’s will all properties,
both English and
Italian,” replies the lawyer,
with the cat’s expression more
accentuated on his countenance.</p>

<p>“And they are very large?”</p>

<p>“Very large. My late client
was an only son, and though
generous, never spendthrift.”</p>

<p>Fanshawe touches Bertram’s
arm. “Wake up, Wilfrid. Do
you hear? Can’t you speak?”</p>

<p>Bertram says wearily, “What
am I to say? It is an unspeakably
awful thing. I really cannot
bring myself to believe in
it.”</p>

<p>“If you will allow me,” says
the solicitor, “to make you
acquainted with some details of
the——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>“To what end? Do the
items of the contents of the
pack interest the pack-horse to
whose aching back the burden
is offered?”</p>

<p>“Again I fail to follow you.”</p>

<p>“To follow him, Mr. Folliott,”
says Fanshawe, “requires
a long course of patient perusal
of the <i>Age to Come</i>.”</p>

<p>“Quite so, quite so,” answers
the solicitor, coldly, in a tone
which intimates that he will
not have that patience. “I
have certainly never seen the
announcement of an inheritance
received in such a manner.”</p>

<p>“But why,” says Bertram—“why
did this relative, whom I
never knew, leave his property
to me?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell, sir. It was
certainly not by the advice of
our firm.”</p>

<p>“Are there any conditions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
attached to this extraordinary
bequest?”</p>

<p>“None, sir. You can realise
at once and invest everything
in dynamite and pyretic acid,”
replies the solicitor, with a
rasping scorn showing through
the velvet of his admirable
manners.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear sir! Can
you fall into the vulgar error
of confounding collectivism and
altruism with anarchy? They
are as far apart as the Poles.
One is love; the other hatred.”</p>

<p>“I confess, sir, that such
love nauseates me. I prefer
of the two the hatred. But
I am an old-fashioned person,
and I know little of literature
later than the ’Sixties.”</p>

<p>“A most debased period in
every form of production.”</p>

<p>“It may be so. Macaulay
was alive in it and Tennyson.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
But I did not come here to
discuss the characteristics of
generations. I came to inform
you of an event which I immaturely
concluded would appear
to you both important and
agreeable.”</p>

<p>“You did not know me, my
dear sir.”</p>

<p>“I did not, sir.”</p>

<p>With a little cough and a
little stately bow the old gentleman
prepares to leave, with the
cat’s glance at the bull terrier still
more hostile and more scared.</p>

<p>“You will be so good, sir,
as to call on us to-morrow
morning, or to send some representative
authorised by you.
You must be aware that the
law requires you either to accept
the bequest or decline it.”</p>

<p>“I am criminal if I accept:
I may be equally criminal if I
reject it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“Again I fail to follow you,
sir. But of course you are
your own master; and in the
event of your failure to call on
us to-morrow morning you will
be so good as to make us acquainted
with your decision and
intentions.”</p>

<p>“I will send you, Mr. Fanshawe,”
replies Bertram.</p>

<p>The solicitor does not look
everjoyed at the promise, but
bows in silence, a very stiff
and formal bow, and leaves the
room without more words.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I was not very
polite to him,” says Bertram,
doubtfully, when the stuffs of
the <i>portière</i> have fallen behind
him.</p>

<p>“You certainly were not,”
replies Fanshawe. “I think
you could give hints to
Whistler on the Gentle Art
of making Enemies. But why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
did you talk all that rot? He
only ridiculed you for it.”</p>

<p>“I merely said what I
meant.”</p>

<p>“You mean to let this
fortune go to Magdalen College?”</p>

<p>“Unless I change my present
intentions very completely.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord! This is green
sickness, moonstruck madness;
Hamlet’s monomania was nothing
to it. Are you absolutely
insensible to the fact that you
would be able to print ten
million copies of the <i>Age to
Come</i> every week and distribute
them gratis all over Great
Britain every week?”</p>

<p>“Even that alluring prospect
cannot tempt me. My acceptance
of a fortune would be as
anomalous as Lord Rosebery’s
creation of peers. Miserable
creatures that we are, we are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
only tolerably respectable so
long as we are commonly consistent.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord save us! You
can’t possibly be serious?”</p>

<p>“I speak in entire sincerity.”</p>

<p>“A very dangerous thing to
do at any time. People have
such a shocking habit of taking
one at one’s word! Old Folliott’s
very shrewd too, though
he’s a Tory.”</p>

<p>“What is his shrewdness to
me?”</p>

<p>“Well, if you retain him as
your man of business it may be
a great deal. It is usual to retain
the testator’s solicitors when
they are as eminent and irreproachable
as Folliott and Hake.”</p>

<p>Bertram grows impatient.</p>

<p>“Cannot you understand?
I do not take this property.
Do not dream of taking it for
a single instant!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“You can’t be such a transcendent
ass! Excuse me,
but——”</p>

<p>“I should have thought <i>you</i>
would have looked at this
matter as I do.”</p>

<p>“Dear boy, all property
<i>ought</i> to be abolished, on that
we are quite agreed, but whilst
it still exists in this piggish
world we are bound in duty
to ourselves and our neighbours
to make the best of it, and get
as much as we can!”</p>

<p>“Then you are a mere sham?
A humbug? A hypocrite?”</p>

<p>“You mean to be rude, but
I take no offence. Everybody
is insincere in civilised countries.”</p>

<p>“What an infamous theory!
I have always thought that
your Richmond villa, your
house at Prince’s Gate, your
swell garden parties, your blood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
horses, and all the rest of it,
were ludicrously out of keeping
with your political and literary
declarations of opinion.”</p>

<p>“Not more so than your
silver tea-set and your exemplary
Critchett are with yours.
Don’t let us quarrel, at least not
until to-morrow. I want to
see more of old Folliott. He
is one of the worst enemies
I have, and I do so delight in
drawing the claws of an enemy
with my bland and benign
manners. Besides, I owe him
a good deal. The <i>Torch</i> was
in its infancy when he made
its fortune and set it on its legs
by his libel suits. Meet me in
Hyde Park at eleven to-morrow.
I’ll come out of my house
through Albert Gate, and we’ll
go down to his office together.”</p>

<p>“You can go, and take my
written refusal with you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>Fanshawe gives a gesture of
irritated impatience, and looks
at his watch.</p>

<p>“<i>La nuit porte conseil.</i> You
will think differently in the
morning. I am dining at Richmond.
I can’t stay another
moment, but for Heaven’s sake
take till to-morrow to think it
over Ta-ta!”</p>

<p>“Good-day.”</p>

<p>Bertram looks out of the
window and watches Fanshawe’s
private hansom flash down Piccadilly;
he vaguely wishes that
he too were going to dine at
Richmond, and were not fettered
by principle to a cheese omelette
and a vol au vent of mushrooms.</p>

<p>It is a fine, breezy sunshiny
morning on the morrow, good
yachting weather, as some one
says who is going down to
Gravesend for the first cutter
race of the season.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>Bertram walks along Rotten
Row under the trees with a
mind so preoccupied that he
narrowly escapes being knocked
down by an ambassadress on a
bicycle. He is repeating to himself
what he said to the old
duke, “fais ce que dois advienne
que pourra,” and he is
conscious that the injunction
has its thorny side like most
other virtuous things.</p>

<p>He has been unable to sleep
all night for the tormenting
visions evoked by Folliott’s
visit and his dead cousin’s
bequest.</p>

<p>Because you valorously resist
a temptation it does not any
the less sharply assail you.
Because you limit yourself
strictly to rice croquettes you
do not the less painfully recall
the forbidden flavour of a salmi
of game. He considers it no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
more possible for him in common
decency to accept this
property than to embrace
Mahomedanism or renounce
clothing; but none the less is
he haunted by the possibilities
that its possession would bring
with it.</p>

<p>He is human, and his heart
is heavy as he walks along
in the pleasant April wind.
He realises that there are
many charming things which he
has renounced—voluntarily renounced,
indeed; but, then, is
it really more agreeable to kill
oneself than to be killed? Anyhow,
the result is the same;
the grave is as deep and the
sleep as eternal.</p>

<p>When he has arrived opposite
the residential hotel which raises
the colossal offence of its eleven
stories between the elm-trees
and their right to air and light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
he sits down, feeling rather limp
and aimless; and lighting a
cigarette, he awaits the coming
of Fanshawe. There is a policeman
close at hand; some children
are near, with their nurses;
and a respectable-looking,
middle-aged, brisk woman, with
some fine linen in a flat basket,
is approaching. He raises his
hat to her.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Mrs. Brown?
I never saw you in the Park
before.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I don’t often come
nigh fine folks,” answers Mrs.
Brown. “But I’ve got to go
to Prince’s Gate, number fifteen,
and I turned in ’ere ’cos the
traffic’s that crowded on the
’igh-road; ’is ’Ighness is agoin’
down to ’Ounslow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, to be sure. How are
your people this morning?”</p>

<p>“My pore legs, sir, be as bad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
as ever—but there, we pore
folks can’t stop for aches and
pains, or we’d never do naught
in this ’ere world; ’twasn’t
made for the likes of us.”</p>

<p>“That is a sad reflection.
But pray don’t say ‘sir’ to
me.”</p>

<p>“It comes nat’ral, sir. I
hev allus been one as did my
humble duty to the quality.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know! It is this
terrible servility which has
entered like blood-poisoning
into the very marrow of the
people.”</p>

<p>The policeman standing near
listening grins behind his white-gloved
hand.</p>

<p>“You are so used to stoop
and cringe that you have lost
the power to stand upright
when you are invited to do
so,” says Bertram, impatiently.
“Where is your daughter?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>“Annie’s at Ealing, sir. It’s
Primrose Day to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“And what is your opinion
of Primrose Day, Mrs.
Brown?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, it’s got ’em lots
o’ votes, but it do seem to me
a pack o’ folly. No offence.”</p>

<p>“And the Primrose Dames,
Mrs. Brown?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, they’re a pretty
spry lot o’ ladies, and they
come and talk, talk, talk, and
me at the mangle, and I wish
’em anywheres; and one o’
’em promised to have my
kitchen boiler looked to, but,
Lord! that’s three months ago
come Monday was a week, and
nobody’s come to the boiler.”</p>

<p>“The Conservative party
always forgets the boilers; and
are extremely astonished when
the neglected boilers blow up.”</p>

<p>“My boiler was no business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
o’ theirs,” says the good woman,
hotly; “but if they said they’d
send, they hought to hev sent.
But there! that’s them ladies
all over, in and out, and to and
fro, and it’s how’s my soul?
and how’s my dust-bin? and
hev I faith? and hev I a patent
kitchener? and do I read my
Bible? and do I keep the traps
on my drains? and do I see
the blessin’s o’ eddication? and
do I keep my sink flushed?
and am I an abstainer? and do
I use carbolic acid? Such a
pack o’ nonsense, and in they
comes without rappin’; and if
they sees a bit o’ dust in a
corner ’tis ‘Lord, Mrs. Brown,
don’t ye know as dust is
microbes, and microbes is sartain
death?’ And I says, says
I, ‘No, marm, my leddy, my
granny lived to ninety-six, and
on her ninetieth birthday she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
walked four miles to market
at Winchester and back, and
she allus said to all o’ us as dust
was wholesome, and cobwebs
too, and shouldn’t ne’er be
interfered with——’”</p>

<p>She stops, out of breath, and
the listening policeman smiles
again.</p>

<p>“People were more robust
in those days, Mrs. Brown,”
remarked Bertram.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, there weren’t so
many doctors all over the place.
When I was a gal, in our
village there weren’t a doctor
within twenty mile; and nobody
never was ill. Nowadays
young and old is allus talking
about their livers and lights till
they fret theirselves into sickness.”</p>

<p>“That is very possible.
Science is much to blame for
teaching humanity to concentrate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
the mind on the body.
There I wholly agree with you.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown picks up her
load of linen, which she has
momentarily rested on the back
of the bench.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, you’ll please
excuse me, but I can’t stand
chatterin’ here. We pore has
got our work to do. That’s
what I says to them ladies when
they come botherin.’ I says,
says I, ‘We pore has our work
to do, and when ’tis done we
want to sit still, and put our
feet up, and take a cup o’ tea,
and doze like; we don’t want
to go strammarkin’ about to
your concerts, and your readin’s,
and your mothers’ meetin’s,
and all them rubbishes, and see
a duchess playin’ a banjo or
hear a duke sing “Hot Codlins.”’
Let ’em keep in their
place, and we’ll keep in ours.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
That’s what I says, sir, and I
bring up my children to say
it arter me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am aware, Mrs.
Brown, you and those who
resemble you, are a terrible
stumbling-block to progress.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t call me names,
sir. I’m a pore workin’ woman,
but I’m one as hev allus kep’
my head above water. You’re
in one speer, and we’re in
another, as I hev allus told ye,
but all the same I choose to be
respecket.”</p>

<p>“My dear creature, no one
can respect you more profoundly
than I do.”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Brown is not
appeased by this assurance;
walks away in high dudgeon;
there is meanwhile a great
noise of yelling and shouting
in the distance near the statue
of Achilles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>“What are they doing?”
Bertram asks of the constable,
who, touching his helmet,
answers:</p>

<p>“Well, sir, the Salvationists
have got new banners, ‘Glory’
on one side, and ‘Eternal Fire’
on t’other; and the pop’lace don’t
like ’em. Pop’lace very queer
and touchy, sir. Never knows
what it wants.”</p>

<p>“That is a hasty condemnation
to pass on those who form
the bulwarks of a nation.”</p>

<p>“Bulwarks, is it, sir? Not
when they’ve got any beer in
’em.”</p>

<p>The uproar in the distance
grows very loud indeed; some
children are alarmed; the nurse
who is with them asks the
policeman if there is any danger
of a riot.</p>

<p>He replies cheerfully, “No
fear, mum. They’re round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
Hachilles; the Salvationists are
on one side, a rum chap hollering
against property on the
other. He’s one o’ them
Communists, and the pop’lace
don’t cotton to them ideas;
pop’lace likes gentlefolks.
Lord! see ’em run to stare at
the carriages o’ Drawing Room
days!”</p>

<p>“What is the use,” thinks
Bertram, “of trying to save
sheep who carry their own
fleeces obstinately to the
shearers?”</p>

<p>“This is the impression,” he
asks of the policeman, “which
years on the London pavement
gives you of the London populace?”</p>

<p>Policeman answers, drily,
“Yessir. All the force’ll tell
ye the same. London populace
likes the nobs. Some on ’em
yell a lot o’ revolutionary nonsense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
when they gets in Trafalgar
Square, but, Lord bless ye,
they don’t mean it.”</p>

<p>“They will mean it one
day.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, if they ever run
short o’ liquor, on account of
them total habstainers, they
will.”</p>

<p>“What a view of the sovereign
people!” says Bertram,
“who in the <i>Age to Come</i>
advocates voluntary total abstinence.”</p>

<p>“Sovereign, is it, sir? Ever
seen ’em o’ Derby Day, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replies Bertram,
curtly. He perceives that the
constable is a satirist.</p>

<p>In sight at that moment
appears a struggling form being
violently propelled by two
officers of the law, and followed
by some yelling roughs and
capering boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>Bertram cannot believe his
senses.</p>

<p>“Good gracious! That is
Hopper!” he says to the
satirical policeman at his side.
“What are they doing to him?
Why is he arrested?”</p>

<p>Policeman replies politely,
but with slightly veiled contempt:
“Seem to be running
him in, sir. Is he a protegy of
yours?”</p>

<p>Bertram goes up to the
prisoner: “Why, Hopper, is
that you? What has he done?
Why do you collar him like
that?”</p>

<p>The constables, who are
dragging Hopper between them,
reply with curt contempt: “Disorderly;
drunk and disorderly,
that’s what he is, sir, and incitin’
to crime.”</p>

<p>“Drunk?” repeats Bertram.
“Hopper? Impossible! He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
has touched nothing but lemonade
and mineral water for three
years!”</p>

<p>“Is that so, sir? Well,
there’s an excuse for him, then,
poor devil!”</p>

<p>The prisoner whines and
weeps, “Is that you, Mr.
Bertram? You’ll speak for a
pore honest man—for a pore
honest man—not a drop hev
Hopper took—not a—not a—not
a drop. Hark’ee, Mister—Hopper
was a-tellin’ folks—good
tidings—proputty’s
pison—proputty’s thievin’—proputty’s
root o’ all evil—said
so yerself, mister. Hopper used
yer werry words. And Hopper’s
run in, and ye stand there—yah!
Blackgud.”</p>

<p>“I am ashamed of you,
Hopper,” says Bertram, sternly.
“But,” he adds to the constables,
“if you arrest this man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
for having taken stimulants, I
cannot oppose the measure, he
may deserve arrest; but if you
consider him guilty because he
has merely striven to disseminate
the doctrines which I myself
hold, I ought in common justice
to accompany him and be
locked up as well.”</p>

<p>The first policeman, who has a
satiric vein, smiles rather cynically:
“Well, sir, I don’t say
as you shouldn’t, but we can’t
run you in, sir; you aren’t
disorderly.”</p>

<p>Marlow, who is sauntering
past, stops, and laughs: “His
opinions are very disorderly.
Half an hour in Bow Street
might be a seasonable douche.”</p>

<p>Hopper is struggling between
the two constables, who have
him by the collar: “Hi, mister!”
he groans, “won’t ye
speak hup for a ’onest man?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
Kep’ me on beastly swills, you
hev—kep’ promisin’ on me
beer’d be free all round—promised
as ’ow I’d live in Windsor
Castle, and hev ale an’ gin on
tap all day—promised as ’ow—promised
as ’ow—promised as
’ow——”</p>

<p>“Shut up his jaw,” says one
of the constables to the other.
“Get him along somehow. We
can’t waste no more time.”</p>

<p>They go down the road,
dragging and pushing Hopper,
a group of small boys dancing
hilariously in their rear.</p>

<p>“I assure you he was an
entirely reformed character, up
to this moment,” says Bertram
to the satirical and remaining
policeman.</p>

<p>“Aye, they’re allus the
worst, sir,” says that functionary,
with conviction.</p>

<p>“Reformed characters have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
a knack of backsliding,” says
Marlow, who has lingered to
look on, with great enjoyment
of the scene. “Vice is magnetic.
Virtue isn’t—somehow.”</p>

<p>Bertram ignores him and
continues to address the policeman:
“I suppose I can witness
on his behalf in the police-court?
Get him out on bail?
My testimony surely——”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I’d let him bide
if I was you,” says the policeman,
without a grain of sympathy.
“Seven days’ll do him
a world o’ good. Wonderful
how it sobers ’em.”</p>

<p>“Why are you so ungenerous
to your own class?”</p>

<p>Policeman looks puzzled:
“Don’t know about ongenerous,
sir; but I didn’t never
cotton to drunkards afore I was
in the force.”</p>

<p>“I thought you were a total<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
abstainer, Bertram?” says Marlow.</p>

<p>Bertram replies, very stiffly:
“Drink is the most disgusting
of all weaknesses, but our disgust
ought not to destroy our
compassion. In that poor man
yonder it is a relapse into a bad
habit after three years of rigorous
abstinence.”</p>

<p>The policeman smothers a decorous
smile: “Beg pardon, sir
that ’ere man was run in dead
drunk a fortnight ago on the
Nottin’ ’Ill road and got two
days.”</p>

<p>Bertram is silent.</p>

<p>He remembers that Hopper
appeared at his chambers ten
days previously with a black
eye and bandaged head, and
accounted for his condition by
a very well-told episode of a
runaway horse and a lady saved
by his courage and resolution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>Marlow laughs, nods, and
walks on; Bertram lights
another cigarette. He is not
pleased by this episode.</p>

<p>Marlow, meanwhile continuing
his walk, comes, some tenth
part of a mile further down the
road, on two ladies, whom he
recognises immediately although
their backs are towards him;
one is Cicely Seymour, the other
Lady Jane Rivaux. He overtakes
them with as much haste
and joyousness as it is possible
for a London man in the ’Nineties
to display in public.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Seymour, such a
lark down there,” he says, with
great satisfaction. “A friend
of Bertram’s run in dead drunk
by the police, and Bertram
preaching red ruin on his behalf.
On my word, it’s the drollest
sight I’ve seen for many a day.”</p>

<p>“It must be,” replied Cicely,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
between her teeth. “We have
all of us numbers of friends who
take more stimulants than are
good for them, but they are
careful to be in the sanctuary
of their own houses or in their
clubs.”</p>

<p>“How you do pull up a
fellow!” murmurs Marlow.
“Of course, when I say friend
I mean a—a—well, one of his
monstrous queer acquaintances.
He lives amongst that class.”</p>

<p>“What class?”</p>

<p>“Well, the—the mob—you
know. Folks that come out
when there’s a riot and smash
windows and lamps; never see
’em any other time; burrow, I
suppose, like rabbits.”</p>

<p>“Darkest London? I fear
the lamps when they are not
smashed do not throw much
light on their darkness.”</p>

<p>“How sententious you are,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
Cicely!” says Lady Jane. “You
ought to marry a rising politician.”</p>

<p>“Because I detest politics?”</p>

<p>“Bertram’s views aren’t politics,
they’re red ruin,” repeats
Marlow. “Red ruin to himself,
too; he’s dropped such a
pot o’ money over that revolutionary
journal of his that he’ll
be in the bankruptcy court
before the season’s over.”</p>

<p>“Has he borrowed any money
of you?” asks Cicely, curtly.</p>

<p>“Oh dear, no; I didn’t
mean to imply——”</p>

<p>“Then what are his affairs
to you?”</p>

<p>“Well—I—I—don’t know.
Mustn’t one talk of one’s
neighbours?”</p>

<p>“It shows great poverty of
mind to speak merely of people.
There are so many other subjects.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>Marlow is abashed.</p>

<p>He knows that his mind is
not rich according to her ideas
of intellectual wealth.</p>

<p>“At all events,” he says,
rather crossly and hotly, “one
may be allowed to envy such a
prig such good luck as to have
Miss Seymour for a champion.”</p>

<p>“Jane,” says Cicely, turning
to her friend, “here come your
children. How well that mite
Dolly rides!”</p>

<p>“He <i>is</i> a prig, you know,
my dear,” murmurs Lady Jane,
“and I am sorry it makes you
angry when we say so.”</p>

<p>“I dislike all injustice,” says
Cicely, coldly, “and I do not
consider that Mr. Bertram is in
the least done justice to by his
friends and relations. How
badly every one treated him
yesterday in return for a most
learned and interesting lecture!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>While she is thus defending
himself and his doctrines in his
absence, Bertram, still seated
under the trees, sees in the distance
a girl’s figure; she wears
a black straw hat, a black jacket,
and a grey stuff skirt; she has
thread gloves and leather highlows,
the highlows are white
with dust; she has two deep
baskets filled with primroses and
covered by red cotton handkerchiefs;
she carries one on each
arm. She has a round, fair,
freckled face, a sweet and cheerful
expression, and a fringe of
naturally curling brown hair.</p>

<p>She approaches Bertram smiling:
“Oh, gracious, sir! Don’t
get up for the likes of me.
Mother told me as how you
were under this tree; I just met
her by the Gate, so I thought
I’d come and have a peep at
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>“Thanks,” replies Bertram,
distantly. “Don’t say ‘as
how,’ Annie. You are heavily
laden this morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir. Primroses
have no roots; they make a
fine show, but they don’t weigh
naught.”</p>

<p>“Like the party of which
they are the emblem.”</p>

<p>Annie smiles, in entire ignorance
of his meaning, and sits
down by him, planting her
baskets on the ground.</p>

<p>“These aren’t very good
flowers,” she says, regretfully,
“the rain’s spiled ’em. They’ll
do to put at the horses’ ears.
Why do they put ’em at the
horses’ ears, sir? I asked a
groom onst, and he says, says
he, it means that when our
party come back to office we’ll
take the tax off horses. Is that
so, sir?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>“They are not only at the
horses’ ears, but at the asses’
button-holes!” says Bertram.
“As for taxation, it is the arc
of Toryism.”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” he thinks,
“why will she sit down by
me? With all the will in
the world one cannot but fret
occasionally at their manners,
though of course manner is only
the shell, and ought not to
weigh with one!”</p>

<p>Annie is meanwhile making
some primroses up into a bunch.
“What had you said to
mother?” she asks. “Her
back was quite set up, like.”</p>

<p>“Your mother,” replies Bertram,
“is the most estimable
and indefatigable of persons,
but she has the taint of painfully
narrowed and archaic
views: she persists in considering
herself of an inferior class;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
she persists in speaking of
‘quality,’ by which she means
the patrician order, as something
superhuman and alien to
herself. It distresses me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! Mother’s always
going on about our engagement.
She says as how——”</p>

<p>“‘As how,’ again, Annie!”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, that’s just what
mother means. You speak in one
way and I in another. And your
friends will laugh at my way of
speaking, sir; they certainly will.”</p>

<p>“Let them laugh! Besides,
we shall not see them, Annie;
we shall live wholly apart from
them, in some remote spot of
our own.”</p>

<p>“Out o’ London, sir?”</p>

<p>“Out of London beyond a
doubt. Is that any subject of
regret?”</p>

<p>“Well—I should miss the
streets, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>“Miss the streets! Merciful
heavens! To what a pass has
the baneful disease of town life
brought a pure and unsophisticated
soul! But you have been
in the country this morning
early—the hem of the country
at any rate. Did the freshness,
the silence, the fragrance around
you say nothing to your heart?”</p>

<p>“Well, no, sir. Where the
growers are you don’t smell
much else than manure; and
there’s a steam pump always
going fit to deafen you.”</p>

<p>“Well, well! But you must
have seen the real country. I
have taken you myself to
Bushey and Thames Ditton.
Surely you must see that the
streets are the quintessence of
vulgarity, of artificiality, of
hideousness, of ludicrous effort?”</p>

<p>“If they’re as bad as that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
sir, why do all the great ladies
stay all the summer in ’em,
when they might be in the
country? Our little street
ain’t much, for sure, but there’s
a deal o’ neighbourliness in it;
and I’m so used to listening for
Sam’s growler rattlin’ home I
don’t think sleep ’ud come to
me without it.”</p>

<p>“We really cannot take Sam
and his cab into our wedded
life,” remarks Bertram, with
irritation; “and why will you
say ‘sir,’ and not Wilfrid?”</p>

<p>“Your Christian name would
sound so cheeky, sir,” replies
Annie. “I couldn’t bring
myself to say it. You’re so
different to me, sir. That’s
what mother allus says: ‘Mr.
Bertram’s got queer notions,’
says she; ‘but he was born
of the quality, and quality he’ll
be till he die, let him fuss and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
fad and fettle as much as ever
he likes.’”</p>

<p>Bertram is looking uneasily
down the Mile: “Won’t your
primroses wither in the sun?”</p>

<p>“No; there’s the shade o’
the tree.”</p>

<p>Bertram says to himself:
“However shall I get rid of
her? If Marlow should come
back while she’s sitting here,
or Fanshawe come out of his
house!” (<i>Aloud.</i>) “Dear
Annie, if you won’t misunderstand
me, I think we’d better
not be seen sitting here together.
Cæsar’s wife—no, I
don’t mean that, I mean an
Englishman’s betrothed—in
fact, you know what I mean.
It was very kind of you to send
those violets yesterday, but it
was a mistake—my rooms were
full—people laughed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Bertram, I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
sorry. It was silly, of course,
now I think of it,” says the
girl, as she rises and takes up
the baskets. “Mr. Bertram, if
you don’t like to be seen with
me settin’ on this bench, how
ever will you stand being seen
with me all your life?”</p>

<p>“You don’t comprehend,”
replies Bertram, nervously.
“That isn’t the question at all.
I don’t want people to say
coarse and rude things of you.
Of my wife no one will ever
dare to do so.”</p>

<p>Annie hangs her head in
silence for a minute; then
murmurs:</p>

<p>“Do you really love me,
sir? Mother says as how it’s
moonshine.”</p>

<p>“I dislike the word love.
It is coarse, and implies coarse
feelings. It is a degrading
impulse, shared with the beasts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
of the fields. Poets are responsible
for having covered
its unloveliness with a starry
garment which has disguised—fatally
disguised—its nakedness.
What I feel for you is respect,
esteem, the sweetness of fulfilled
duty, the means of proving
to the world the sincerity
of my sociology.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. You told me
that afore.”</p>

<p>“Well, what better sentiment
can you desire? Love
fills lunatic asylums, divorce
courts, cemeteries, heats charcoal
braziers, fires revolvers,
gives human bodies to fishes;
but such a sentiment as I
have for you purifies society,
advances civilisation, ensures
mutual respect, and eliminates
passion, the tyrant of man.”</p>

<p>He stops abruptly, for before
his memory floats the vision of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
Cecily Seymour, and he seems
to hear her saying: “What
heresy! And how untrue!”</p>

<p>Annie murmurs, keeping her
head down, and in a disappointed
voice: “Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“You do not seem to understand!
You are vexed?”</p>

<p>“I’ll try to understand, sir.
I’m only a poor girl, and all
that you say is very beautiful,
I dessay; but—it makes me
think of a novel I got onst
from the library, where a poor
governess, without a umberellar
or a friend, stands out in the
rain and looks through the
winder at a cosy kitchen, where
they’re a-toastin’ muffins for
tea, and a cat’s a-warming hisself
at the fire.”</p>

<p>“‘Jane Eyre.’ I fail to see
the connection.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Bertram, I say
it ill; but when you talk in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
that kind o’ way it makes me
feel out in the cold like as
that poor teacher was, and I
think I’d rather have the fire
and the muffins and the cat.”</p>

<p>“I fear you are a sad Philistine,
Annie.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what that is,
sir. I daresay as it’s only that
your beautiful talk’s too fine
for me. I think I’ll go now.
I didn’t ought to have dawdled
here.”</p>

<p>“You are crying, child!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir.”</p>

<p>She gets up and hurries
away.</p>

<p>“O Heavens!” Bertram
says to himself. “One does
not go to that sturdy class to
get a sensitive plant that droops
at a touch. She says <i>liberry</i> and
<i>umberellar</i>. It is absurd that
such a trifle should irritate one,
but it does; it is like a grain of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
dust in one’s eye, a crumb of
bread in one’s sock. What
atoms they are, yet how miserable
they can make one! And
then her absolute inability to
understand one! Love! Good
gracious! She would want to
have a bride cake from Gunter’s;
a temple of Hymen in
spun sugar!”</p>

<p>The remembrance of Cicely
Seymour’s fair face, with its
tender, dreamy eyes and its
beautiful mouth, comes over
him. He shivers in the warmth
of the pleasant and unusual
sunshine.</p>

<p>Marlow, who has left the
ladies after his snubbing, passes
him again, puts his glass in his
eye, and gazes after Annie
Brown.</p>

<p>“A <i>protégée</i>? Younger
than your disciples usually
are,” he remarks. “Ah, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
be sure—that must be the
Annie of the violets? My
dear Bertram, surely chivalry
should suggest that we should
carry her baskets for her? If
you will take the one, I will
take the other.”</p>

<p>Bertram deigns no answer.
He feels considerably annoyed,
and gazes at the cupola of the
hotel in front of him.</p>

<p>Marlow digs holes in the
gravel with his cane.</p>

<p>“What an opportunity lost
of practical illustration of your
doctrines, and—she’s got a
smart pair of ankles; rather
thick, but still——”</p>

<p>Bertram continues to gaze
abstractedly at the hotel roof.</p>

<p>“But why, oh why, let her
wear highlows?” continues
Marlow. “They would deform
a goddess.”</p>

<p>Suddenly, with the sense of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
taking a plunge into water of
unknown depth, the man whom
he torments faces what he considers
an imperative obligation.</p>

<p>“The young person in the
highlows is my future wife,”
he says between his teeth.
“You will be so good as to
make your jokes about some
other matter than her ankles.”</p>

<p>Marlow stares, utterly incredulous
and stupefied.</p>

<p>“Good Lord! you can’t
mean it! Your wife? Why,
she is—she is—she is a very
decent sort of girl no doubt;
I should be sorry to imply the
contrary, but——”</p>

<p>“Be so good as to understand
that I am not in jest.
That is the—the—the daughter
of the people who I am about
to marry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord!”</p>

<p>Marlow drops into a chair,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
so astonished that he could not
recover his speech. Annie is
too far off to hear, and there
is no one else within earshot
except a groom on the other
side of the rails; the policeman
has gone on down the road.</p>

<p>“I was much to blame,” says
Bertram, in his chilliest manner,
“not to make the announcement
yesterday when you asked
who were the Brown family.
My reticence was a weakness of
which I am sincerely ashamed.”</p>

<p>He has done what he believes
that courage, truth, and loyalty
to this poor little girl with the
primrose skips demanded, but
doing our duty, unhappily, is
apt to leave a shivery and
prickly sensation behind it, and
his reasons do not, even to himself,
appear so logical, admirable,
and clear as they had done
three months ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>And why will she say
“<i>liberry</i>” and “<i>umberellar</i>”?
and her ankles certainly are
thick! He tries to remember
Sybil in Disraeli’s romance of
that name, but he cannot conceal
from his mind that Annie
is not in the very least like
Sybil, if he himself somewhat
resembles Egremont.</p>

<p>“And may I tell people?”
asks Marlow, with his eyes
staring wide open.</p>

<p>“You may tell every one.
The office of bellman to society
is, I believe, very congenial to
you.”</p>

<p>“Eh? Lord, how they will
laugh! They’ll die of laughin’.”</p>

<p>Bertram reddens angrily.</p>

<p>“No doubt they will laugh.
Such laughter is still as like the
crackling of thorns under a
pot as it was in the days of
Solomon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>Marlow continues to stare
stupidly.</p>

<p>“Are you sure you aren’t
jokin’? chaffin’? humbuggin’?”
he asks.</p>

<p>“I do not joke,” replies
Bertram, with chill dignity.
“And certainly I should not
use banter on so delicate and
solemn a subject. If you think
the actions of my insignificant
personality will amuse people,
you are at liberty to amuse them.”</p>

<p>With that he nods slightly,
and walks towards the French
Embassy, leaving Marlow rooted
to his chair, still staring with a
blank expression of incredulity
and amaze.</p>

<p>“And that prig, that dolt,
that triple idiot might marry
Cicely Seymour if he chose!”
mutters the young man with the
gold crook of his cane between
his teeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>Marlow cannot believe his
own senses. It is eleven o’clock
in the morning, and he has
taken nothing but some black
coffee and a devilled kidney,
or he really would think he
had been drinking, and forgotten
the debauch.</p>

<p>He feels that it would be
very agreeable to his feelings
to return to barbarian methods
and pound into a jelly the
highly cultured brains of the
author of the <i>Age to Come</i>.</p>

<p>“But what do you marry
her for?” he shouts after
Bertram’s retreating figure.
He receives no answer, and
Bertram passes away under the
budding April boughs. To
explain his reasons to Marlow
would be indeed to throw
pearls before swine.</p>

<p>As he walks backward in
the direction of Hyde Park<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
Corner he sees the figure of
Annie Brown going down the
almost-deserted roadway of the
drive.</p>

<p>“Her ankles <i>are</i> thick,” he
thinks painfully; “and why will
she use such very odd words as
‘<i>liberry</i>’? Why? I believe
philologists consider that the
vernacular of the illiterate is
the purest Saxon English
spoken; but it grates unpleasantly
on one’s ears. Is
that you, Fanshawe, at last?”</p>

<p>Fanshawe, who has come out
of his house, which is near to
the French Embassy, fixes his
eyeglass on the retreating figure
of the unconscious Annie. He
is of a supernatural quickness
of observation.</p>

<p>Bertram, to his vexation, feels
extreme embarrassment. He
knows he ought to repeat to
Fanshawe the confession just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
made to Marlow, but he cannot;
it sticks in his throat like a
fish bone. The eyes of the
potent editor are malicious and
inexorable.</p>

<p>“I saw you from my bedroom
window sitting with that
young daughter of the sovereign
people,” remarks Fanshawe.
“I wished for a Kodak. The
<i>Torch</i> should have had an
illustrated Easter number.”</p>

<p>“You are fifty minutes late,”
says Bertram, irritably.</p>

<p>“My dressing-gown and
chocolate pot are dear to me.”</p>

<p>“You always turn night into
day.”</p>

<p>“Night is day in London, as
coal and electricity are its summer.
Well, sha’n’t we take a
hansom to Folliott’s?”</p>

<p>“Wait a moment, Fanshawe.
Sit down here.”</p>

<p>Fanshawe complies reluctantly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
“Why waste time?
Let’s go and settle your inheritance.”</p>

<p>“Please go instead of me
and say that I refuse. It is
very simple.”</p>

<p>“It is simple indeed! So
was the remark of ‘Tom’s a’
cold’; and just about as
reasonable. My dear Bertram!
<i>La nuit porte conseil</i>, and
yet you still wish to refuse?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I refuse; and——”</p>

<p>He pauses, then swallows the
fish bone desperately.</p>

<p>“And—I am going to marry
yonder daughter of the people!”</p>

<p>“Ah! Rumour for once is
correct, then?” says the gentleman,
to whom the amplification
and publication of Rumour
brings in £40,000 per annum.</p>

<p>“Yes, I marry the young
woman you saw when you
wished for a Kodak.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span></p>

<p>For once Fanshawe has not
a syllable to say: he is dumb.</p>

<p>“You look astonished,” remarks
Bertram. “Yet with
your principles——”</p>

<p>“Principles be damned!”
says Fanshawe. “They must
go to the wall when they trample
on common sense.”</p>

<p>“But surely for you no class
divisions exist?” says Bertram,
with some maliciousness.
“Therefore of course you will
congratulate me as warmly as if
my future wife were that abominable
thing a duke’s daughter.”</p>

<p>“There ought to be no race-horses,
but while there are we
put our money on them,” replied
Fanshawe. “We must
take the world as it is, or cut
our throats in it. You are
cutting yours with a bowie
knife. I will return to my
chocolate pot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>At that instant Mrs. Brown
comes down the road out of
breath. Annie is out of sight.</p>

<p>“I am come after my
daughter, Mr. Bertram, if you
please. Soon as I told her ye
was here I was that mad with
myself, for it flashed across me
she’d come and——”</p>

<p>“And why not, madam?”
says Fanshawe. “It is, it
seems, all <i>en tout bien, tout
honneur</i>.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand gibberish,
sir, but girls should be
circumspec.”</p>

<p>Fanshawe gazes at her
through his eyeglass.</p>

<p>“Your mother-in-law to
be?” he murmurs.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown, not hearing,
goes on in a rather shrill
tone: “I don’t mean my
daughter to walk along with
you, sir, till she’s a right to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
take your arm afore everybody.”</p>

<p>Bertram shudders.</p>

<p>Fanshawe lifts his hat to
Mrs. Brown approvingly.</p>

<p>“These sentiments, madam,
do you the highest honour.
The quality, as you would call
them, are not so severe. Their
young ladies sit out on the
staircases, and flirt in corners
with their young men, and
meet them in these sylvan
groves with a groom as chaperon,
without any certainty that
matrimony will ever follow.
But then the <i>demi-vierge</i> is
probably confined to the Upper
Ten.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about the
ways o’ the gentry, sir,” says
Mrs. Brown; “in our street
we’re respectable though we <i>are</i>
back o’ Portman Square.”</p>

<p>“Madam! Juvenal himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
never implied anything so
crushing! Bertram, I ask
again, is this good lady about
to be your mother-in-law?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool.”</p>

<p>“Well, dear madam, it is
but right that, standing in this
future relation to my friend,
you should know this fact:
Mr. Bertram has had a very
large property left him.”</p>

<p>“Lawk a mussy, sir!”</p>

<p>“But he is inclined to refuse
it on account of his social
principles, with which, no
doubt, you are acquainted.
Now, dear madam, tell us
freely your opinion as a person
of sound common sense, and
one who is about to be closely
allied to him. Should he refuse
it, or should he accept it?”</p>

<p>“Dearie, dearie, sir! How
can anybody hev left good
money to such a gawk!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>Fanshawe laughs aloud:
“When Truth comes out of
her well she is seldom polite!
Never mind, Mrs. Brown, you
can make your peace with your
son-in-law some other time.
Only tell us now, for we are
going to the lawyers on this
momentous errand. Ought he
to accept or to refuse?”</p>

<p>Annie’s mother is flattered at
the deference to her opinion.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, it ain’t for the
like o’ me to judge for the likes
o’ you. But, if ye want my
plain opinion, it is this ’un: if
he take the proputty he’ll <i>look</i>
silly. But if he don’t take it
he’ll <i>be</i> silly; and he’ll be sorry
all his life.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Brown,” says Bertram,
“your daughter would
not say so.”</p>

<p>“Likely not, sir. She’s a
slim snippet of a girl as haven’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
felt any o’ the weight o’ livin’
yet. When she hev she’ll know
a full money-box is the softest
pillar one can lay a tired head
on any night.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Brown, the classic form
of Socrates dwindles before
yours! I place you immediately
upon the staff of the <i>Torch</i>.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown is puzzled. “I
don’t hold with torches, sir.
Sam’s link-boy, last week in
the great fog, flourishing one
about like a fool, set fire to all
the straw—such a piece o’ work—and
Sam warn’t hinsured.”</p>

<p>“I wince under the moral
lesson which you convey by
your apologue to my journal,
but——”</p>

<p>“How much longer are you
going to waste in chaffing this
woman?” says Bertram, very
angrily. “There’s an empty
hansom passing. Take it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>“Take it yourself. Mrs.
Brown, your lips drop pearls of
wisdom. Yet you are servile,
Mrs. Brown. Are we not all
equal before the great Bona Dea
of Nature?”</p>

<p>“Equal, sir?” repeats Mrs.
Brown, with fine scorn. “That’s
<i>his</i> rot; yet when he come to
our place one day, and we was
eatin’ good Dutch cheese and
’errings, he well-nigh fainted at
the stink on ’em!”</p>

<p>Fanshawe laughs delightedly.</p>

<p>“He live on peaches and
pinehapples, he do,” she continued,
with a snort; “and he’s
spoilt a good seasonable chance
o’ settlin’ herself as my
daughter had with the young
man round the corner——”</p>

<p>“Shut up that jaw, Fanshawe!”
cries Bertram, falling
into low language in his wrath.</p>

<p>“Will you go to Folliott<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
and Hake’s or not?” asks his
friend.</p>

<p>“I will go to Satan’s self to
stop you chaffing this woman.
Look how those people are
laughing.”</p>

<p>Bertram calls the passing
hansom and gets into it; Fanshawe
follows him, and waves
his hand to Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>“You must come and dine
with me at Richmond, Mrs.
Socrates!”</p>

<p>Cicely and her cousin are
sitting under a tree near the end
of the Ladies’ Mile with some
men standing before them and
talking to them, when Marlow
again approaches, diffident, but
in ill-concealed triumph.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lady Jane,” he says
eagerly, not venturing to address
Cicely directly, “I’ve come
back ’cos I’ve such a bit of
news; am authorised to tell it;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
may put it in the <i>Morning
Post</i> to-morrow. I’ve seen
‘the penny bunch of violets,’
and by all that’s awful, she’s a
washerwoman’s daughter, and
Bertram’s going to marry her.
It’s Annieism you see, not
Altruism.”</p>

<p>Much pleased with his own
wit and humour he laughs
gleefully, whilst his eyes are
trying to read Cicely’s face; it
gives no sign of any feeling or
of having even heard what he
has said.</p>

<p>“What nonsense you talk,
Lord Marlow!” says Lady
Jane. “Bertram may be silly,
but he is not so utterly out of
his mind as that.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t he? Why, he’s just
told me the news himself!
The young woman was with
him down yonder. She sells
flowers, and had got two skips<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
full of primroses; and she’s
not a good feature in her face.
I’ll offer to be best man; shall
I send ’em a set of saucepans
or a sewing-machine?”</p>

<p>Cicely casts a look of supreme
contempt upon him.</p>

<p>“The perfection to which
you bring your jokes must have
cost you a long apprenticeship
on Bank Holidays, Lord Marlow.”</p>

<p>Marlow’s mirth is a little
subdued.</p>

<p>“You can’t be speaking
seriously,” says one of the men
present. “Bertram is not quite
such an ass as that.”</p>

<p>“I am, though,” replies
Marlow, sulkily. “I’ve seen
the girl, and Bertram’s just
told me to tell everybody.”</p>

<p>“What is her name?”</p>

<p>“She’s Annie Brown; we
heard that yesterday. Mother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
takes in washing. Oh, Lord,
it’ll kill me, the fun of it.”</p>

<p>Doubled up with silent
laughter he leans upon his
cane and furtively watches
Cicely’s face.</p>

<p>“Why should you be surprised
that Mr. Bertram puts
his theories into practice?”
she says, coldly. “It is only
like Count Tolstoi’s ploughing.”</p>

<p>“Goodness, Cicely!” says
Lady Jane, with much irritation.
“You surely can’t defend
such an insanity as this?
It is very much worse than any
plough. I thought his manner
very odd yesterday about those
violets; for he is not, you
know, a man <i>à bonnes fortunes</i>.”</p>

<p>“You would approve him
more if he were!”</p>

<p>“Well, they are less serious,”
answers Lady Jane. “You can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
get rid of <i>them</i>; but an Annie
Brown when you have once
married her——”</p>

<p>“At all events,” says Cicely,
“whatever it may be, it is
certainly only the business of
those concerned in it, and none
of ours. Why are you not
already on your way to the
newspaper offices, Lord Marlow?
I believe they give a
guinea for first news.”</p>

<p>“Bertram may be so happy
as to interest you, Miss Seymour,”
says Marlow, sullenly,
“but he’s an unknown quantity
to the world in general. Nobody’d
give twopence for any
news of him.”</p>

<p>“Certainly he is not chronicled
as the winner at pigeon-shooting
and polo matches,
which is your distinction, Lord
Marlow, and I believe your
only one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>“Why will you be so unkind
to Marlow?” asks Lady Jane,
as, having shaken off their
admirers, they walk back alone.</p>

<p>“I grant,” she continues, as
poor Marlow, mortified, falls
behind, “that he is not an extraordinarily
brilliant person;
he will not head the Cabinet
or be President of the Royal
Society, but his temper is kind
and his character blameless.”</p>

<p>“One would think you were
recommending a groom! You
may safely add that his hand is
light and his seat is sure, for
riding is his solitary accomplishment!”</p>

<p>“My dear child, how remarkably
severe you are! Will
you tell me what use to Wilfrid
Bertram are the incontestable
talents with which he
was born? What does he do
with them? Write in such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
manner that if he were a native
of any other country than England
he would have been lodged
in prison years ago.”</p>

<p>Cicely Seymour is silent.</p>

<p>She has read some numbers
of the <i>Age to Come</i>, and she
cannot honestly say that she
approves of its subversive tendencies.
She looks straight
before her with a heightened
colour, and the rose-leaves of
her lips are pressed together
in irritation.</p>

<p>“I suppose you will offer to
be bridesmaid to Miss Annie
Brown,” says Lady Jane, irritably.</p>

<p>“Why not?” says Cicely,
very coldly. “One attends
many weddings brought about
by more ignoble motives.”</p>

<p>“You will not see me at the
ceremony,” replies Lady Jane,
more and more incensed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>“I know I shall not, nor any
of his relatives. But I do not
admire the class prejudice which
will keep you all away.”</p>

<p>And she leans over the rail
of the Ride and pats the mane
of a child’s pony.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mrs. Brown,
resting her empty basket and
her rheumatic limbs for a few
minutes on a bench, ponders
vainly on the name Mr. Fanshawe
gave her. “Mrs. Sockatees,”
she repeats to herself.
“He can’t think as I’m one to
marry agen at my time o’ life.
If it hadn’t bin for the children
there were a tallow chandler, a
warm man too, he was, who
would hev bin ready as
ready——”</p>

<p>She muses pensively a moment
on the charms of the lost
tallow chandler who had been
sacrificed to her maternal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
scruples, whilst Cicely Seymour
and Lady Jane are walking
towards her.</p>

<p>“Let’s sit down here a moment,
Cicely,” says Lady Jane.
“The children will be back
again directly.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown rises and curtsies,
taking up her basket.</p>

<p>“Don’t get up, my good
woman, there’s room enough.”</p>

<p>“Your ’umble servant,
ma’am,” says Mrs. Brown,
standing erect, her empty
basket held before her like a
shield of Boadicea; she does
not know them by name, but
they are possible clients for the
wash-tub.</p>

<p>“Why should you stand?”
says Cicely. “These seats are
free to all.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, miss, but I know
my duty.” Then she adds, insinuatingly,
“If you should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
wanting a laundress, ma’am,
you’d be doin’ a charity to remember
me—Eliza Brown, o’
20, Little Double Street, back
o’ Portman Square; no acids
used, miss, and no machine-work.”</p>

<p>Cicely looks at her, and with
some hesitation asks:</p>

<p>“Are you—are you—the
mother of a young person called
Annie Brown? She has just
gone past here with some primroses.”</p>

<p>“Yes, miss, I be.”</p>

<p>“Of Mr. Bertram’s heroine!”
adds Lady Jane, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Please ’m, don’t call her
names, ma’am,” says Annie’s
mother, quickly. “She’s a good
girl, though I say it as shouldn’t
say it, and there’s nought to
laugh at, unless it be the gentleman’s
rubbish.”</p>

<p>“You don’t seem to be grateful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
for the compliment he pays
to your family,” says Lady
Jane, much amused.</p>

<p>“Compliment is it, my lady?
The gentleman’s a crank, that’s
what he is; he won’t never
marry her, and there’s a good
young man round the corner as
is left out in the cold. He’s in
the greengrocery line, and hev
got a good bit o’ money put
by, and the match ’ud be
suitable in every way, for my
daughter’s a good judge o’
green stuff.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Brown,” says Cicely,
“I should like to have the pleasure
of knowing your daughter.
Will you bring her to see me?
I am staying with Mr. Bertram’s
aunt, Lady Southwold.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown stares hard.</p>

<p>“You do my girl a great
honour, miss, but her head’s
turned too crazy as ’tis. Poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
folks, miss, ain’t got no place
with rich ’uns.”</p>

<p>“That is a rather narrow
feeling, Mrs. Brown,” says
Cicely; “and surely your
daughter ought to begin to
know Mr. Bertram’s friends
and relatives?”</p>

<p>“She won’t never be nought
to Mr. Bertram, miss,” replies
Mrs. Brown, very confidently.
“’Tis a pack of stuff their
thinkin’ on it. Lord, my
lady, if you only see his shirts,
that fine as cobwebs is coarse to
’em!”</p>

<p>Lady Jane is much diverted.</p>

<p>“She evidently does not believe
in the seriousness of Bertram’s
intentions, Cicely.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown tucks her basket
under her arm.</p>

<p>“You’ll excuse me, my
ladies, if I don’t stay to prate.
Us poor folks ’even’t got time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
to lose in gossip; and if you
can give me work, ’m, I’ll be
truly thankful to you, ma’am—Eliza
Brown, 20, Little Double
Street, back o’ Portman Square.
Your servant, ladies.”</p>

<p>With that she bobs a curtsey
and departs.</p>

<p>“A nice honest woman,” says
Cicely.</p>

<p>Lady Jane laughs.</p>

<p>“She doesn’t appreciate Bertram
or his shirts. What right
has he, with his principles, to
wear lawn shirts? He ought
to wear hemp.”</p>

<p>Cicely traces patterns on the
gravel with her sunshade.</p>

<p>“I should like to see the
girl.”</p>

<p>“Why? You may be sure
she is a little horror.”</p>

<p>“I am sure she is a very
good girl,” says Cicely. “I
am sure she is a very good girl.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
A person must be good that
lives amongst flowers.”</p>

<p>“Florists are not all saints,”
replies Lady Jane, out of
patience; “and it does not
seem an exalted mission to
make button-holes for mashers.
There is not even the excuse
of good looks for Bertram’s
aberration. She is quite a plain
little thing, Marlow says.”</p>

<p>“Let us take another turn,”
says Cicely. “We shall see the
children again.”</p>

<p>Bertram returns from his visit
to Folliott and Hake at two
o’clock that day. He intended
going down into the country to
a friend’s house—a friend who
buys Whistlers, adores Mallarme
and Verlaine, writes
studies on the <i>pointillistes</i>, and
has published a volume of five
hundred pages on Strindberg—but
he feels indisposed for even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
that sympathetic society. He
sends a telegram to excuse himself,
and opens his own door
with his latch-key.</p>

<p>His rooms are <i>en suite</i>, one
out of another, and from the
door-mat he can see through all
four of them, between the curtains
of Eastern stuffs which
he had brought home years
before from Tiflis. He cannot
believe in the sight which meets
his eyes in the third room,
which is his study.</p>

<p>There is in that room a large
Florentine cabinet of tortoise-shell
and brass-work; the key
of the drawers thereof is on his
watch-chain; yet he perceives
that the drawers are all open,
their contents are strewn about,
and stooping down over them
is Critchett.</p>

<p>Critchett’s back is unmistakable;
it has as much character<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
in it as the profile of Cæsar or
Napoleon.</p>

<p>Bertram walks noiselessly
over the thick carpets, and
touches him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“You!—a common thief!”</p>

<p>Critchett stumbles to his feet,
pulls himself erect rather nervously,
and faces his employer.
In his right hand is a pearl
necklace.</p>

<p>“I beg pardon, sir,” he murmurs.
“I thought you had
gone to Mr. Domville’s. I
was coming down with the
valise.”</p>

<p>Bertram takes the pearls out
of his grasp; he has grown
much paler than his nefarious
valet. He is cut to the heart.</p>

<p>“A common thief—you!”
he repeats. The <i>Et tu Brute</i>
had not more pathetic reproval
in it.</p>

<p>Critchett in the interval has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
recovered his self-possession, and
what more vulgar persons would
call his cheek.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, sir. There
aren’t such a thing as theft.
What is called theft is only an
over-violent readjustment of
unfairly divided values. I’ve
read it in the <i>Age to Come</i>.”</p>

<p>“You infernal scoundrel!
These are my dead mother’s
jewels!”</p>

<p>“I know they are, sir. They
were doing no good here; and
you told the ladies yesterday as all
jewellery was an abomination.”</p>

<p>“This is probably not the
first time by many that you
have robbed me?”</p>

<p>“I let nobody else steal a
farthing from you, sir.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! You like vicarious
virtue! How could you open
the cabinet? It has a Bramah
lock.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>“And this here’s a Bramah
pick-lock, sir,” says Critchett,
displaying an elegant little tool.</p>

<p>“You infernal scoundrel!”
repeats Bertram. “If I did my
duty, I should give you to the
police.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir, you couldn’t
do that to be consistent; and
consistency is the first of virtues.
I’ve heard you say, sir, that prevention
is suggestion, and that
if there was no constables there’d
be no crime. In locking up this
cabinet you put into my mind
the idea of opening it. It is
you, sir, who are to blame,
not I.”</p>

<p>Critchett smiles demurely as
he repeats these words.</p>

<p>“You have debased me, sir,
by making me fill a servile
office,” he adds. “No man
should serve another. You’ve
said so often.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>Bertram is silent, unspeakably
annoyed, mortified, and
distressed. He cannot discuss
ethics with a treacherous valet.</p>

<p>“I believed in you, Critchett,”
he says, after a pause.</p>

<p>Critchett smiles.</p>

<p>“I know you did, sir; you
believe in a lot o’ things as
won’t wash.”</p>

<p>“And you feel no remorse
for having deceived me?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. Remorse aren’t
seen outside the theatres, I
think. ’Tis a word, sir. ’Tis
only a word.”</p>

<p>Bertram is silent. The cheap
cynicism of this man, who has
lived beside him during a dozen
years, is revolting.</p>

<p>“You are aware I could have
you arrested?” he says, after a
pause.</p>

<p>“No, sir, you couldn’t,” replies
Critchett, calmly. “You’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
be giving the lie to all your own
theories. Try and look at it
philosophic-like, sir.”</p>

<p>Bertram feels a violent longing
to call up the policeman
now passing by the rails of the
Green Park. He puts a five-pound
note on the table.</p>

<p>“Take your wage for the
coming month, and begone.”</p>

<p>“It is usual, sir,” objects
Critchett, “to give more than
a month’s anticipatory honorarium
on parting after such
long association.”</p>

<p>This is the drop too much
which makes the cup of Bertram’s
patience overflow.</p>

<p>“You impudent villain,” he
exclaims. “The only payment
you deserve is the treadmill. Do
not stretch my patience too far.”</p>

<p>Critchett perceives that his
long docile victim is roused,
and may become dangerous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>He retreats meekly.</p>

<p>“Would you wish to examine
my portmanteau, sir?”</p>

<p>“No,” says Bertram. “Begone.”</p>

<p>Critchett bows very low.</p>

<p>“I have only put your theories
into practice, sir,” he says, when
he has reached a safe distance;
“and you will be sorry if you
send me away. You won’t find
another Critchett very easily.”</p>

<p>Bertram turns his back on
him; he feels again a great
inclination to summon the constable
who is walking in the
street below.</p>

<p>The man having at last departed,
he picks up the various
objects and begins to replace
them in the drawers of the
cabinet. He is depressed and
humiliated. For over twelve
years he has implicitly trusted
Critchett, believed in him, extolled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
him, and depended on
him; taking his excellent service
as a surety for moral excellence,
as most of us do with
our servants.</p>

<p>The cool impertinence with
which the thief has quoted his
own writings and sayings against
him mortifies him; he is conscious
that Critchett must have
always considered him an ineffable
idiot. It is not soothing
to one’s self-respect to realise
that for more than a dozen
years one has been made a fool
of successfully.</p>

<p>The sight of his mother’s
jewels also saddens him; he
had been her favourite son, and
he had loved her tenderly.</p>

<p>“You will keep them for
your wife, Wilfrid,” she had
said to him, when she had given
him the pearls and other ornaments
on her death-bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>What would his mother
say, were she living, to such
a wife for him as poor little
Annie Brown? Poor Annie!
Who said “as how” and “umberellar,”
and who “liked to ’ear
the growlers come rattlin’ ’ome
o’ nights.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Bertram,” says the
voice of Annie at that moment
timidly. She has come through
the anteroom of which Critchett
has left the door open behind
him. She wears the same clothes
that she wore in the Park, but
she carries no baskets on her
arms.</p>

<p>Noticing Bertram’s preoccupied
and distressed expression
and the litter of objects on the
floor, she is afraid she appears
at an inopportune moment.</p>

<p>“Lord’s sakes, sir!” she murmurs,
“what hev happened?”</p>

<p>“Critchett is a thief, Annie.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
I caught him in the act,” replies
Bertram, with tragic force.</p>

<p>“Mother always knew as he
was so, sir,” replies the girl, not
astonished. “But she didn’t
dare to tell you. You was
that fond on him.”</p>

<p>“How could she possibly
know?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, he was allers a-boasting
of ’ow he fleeced you.
I believe all the gentlemen’s
gentlemen in these ’ere parts o’
London know how he tricked
ye. Law, sir, he even pawned
your shirts!”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you warn
me?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, sir, we didn’t
like to lose a man his place.”</p>

<p>“You condoned a felony
sooner?”</p>

<p>“Please, sir, I don’t know
what that is. But poor folk
don’t never take the bread out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
of each other’s mouths. And,
besides, you wouldn’t have believed
anybody against Critchett,
sir. You were that wrapped up
in him.”</p>

<p>“How cruelly one may be
deceived!”</p>

<p>“’Tis easy to deceive you,
sir, as instead of seeing people
as they is, you see ’em as you
fancies ’em to be.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so. I fear I am a
greater fool than I thought.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir; only too
trustin’ like.”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” says Bertram,
much irritated, “Critchett is a
thing of the past. We will
never speak of him. But why
have you come to my rooms,
my dear girl? It is not—not
quite—correct. Cæsar’s wife
you know. But perhaps you
never heard of her——”</p>

<p>“No, sir. Who was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
lady? I only came to say a
word, Mr. Bertram. There
aren’t no harm in it, though
mother would be angry over
the place.”</p>

<p>“If you had sent me a line
I would have called on you.”</p>

<p>“You see, sir, mother’s and
sister Kate’s at home, they’d
hear every word, and I want to
speak to you all alone. I won’t
be many minutes. I don’t think
it’s any harm my comin’, though
mother would be fit to kill me
if she knew——”</p>

<p>“Your mother is quite right
in her views, Annie. Young
women cannot be too circumspect.”</p>

<p>“I’m allus circumspec’, sir;
and—oh, Lord, Mr. Bertram,
what a beautiful string o’
pearls!”</p>

<p>“They were my mother’s,
Annie. They will be yours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>“Mine, sir! Lord, never!
The idea of Critchett takin’
them pearls. Why they must
be worth thousands and thousands!”</p>

<p>“No, a few hundreds. My
mother left these things to me
for my wife when I should have
one. They are very sacred to
me. They will be as dear to
you, Annie, I am sure?”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir, they’ll never be
mine. You might as well talk
of my wearin’ the crown of
England.”</p>

<p>“Always low and servile
comparisons, Annie!”</p>

<p>“Lord, sir, be a queen’s
crown low?”</p>

<p>“To think of it as a desirable
and enviable thing is extremely
low.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid, sir, I don’t
understand. Will you please
put up these pearls? They’re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
that beautiful I don’t dare
touch ’em.”</p>

<p>“They will be my wife’s.
Therefore I repeat they will be
yours.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I come to say
to you, sir. What we have
thought of won’t never be.
Can’t never be. Tisn’t in
reason. When the ’bus run
over me in Piccadilly last year,
and you picked me up and took
me ’ome, you seemed like a
prince to me, sir——”</p>

<p>“Always vulgar and servile
comparisons!”</p>

<p>“And when you come about
our place, mother said to me,
‘That gent don’t mean no
good, and it’s the broom I’ll
take to him’; and Sam he said,
‘If he’s harter Hann I’ll give
’im a ’idin’.’ And then you
said we was to marry, and
mother said it was all moonshine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span> 
and Sam didn’t like the
idea of it; but you said it
would be a beautiful example
to all classes, and I—I—well I
couldn’t believe my ears, Mr.
Bertram.”</p>

<p>“What is the use of going
over all this ground, Annie?”</p>

<p>“I want you to understand,
sir. I’ve been thinkin’ and
thinkin’ of all you said yesterday,
and I see, sir, as how you
haven’t a mite o’ love for me,
and it makes me feel cold all
over like——”</p>

<p>“Oh, why do you want
love? It is something so vulgar,
so unspiritual, so indicative
of an unoccupied mind! I
have the highest respect for you,
which I am about to prove in the
strongest manner that any man
can prove his sentiments——”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, sir; but—but——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>“But there are finer sentiments
than love!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps there are, sir, for
the quality. But love’s poor
people’s feast; the only one
they ever knows all their days.
And—you—don’t love me?”</p>

<p>She looks at him fixedly.</p>

<p>He is embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Should I have given you
my mother’s pearls if I did
not?”</p>

<p>“You haven’t giv’ ’em, and
I haven’t took ’em. Some
other than me ’ll wear ’em.
I came to say to you, Mr.
Bertram, that I won’t never
marry you. Mother says as
’ow you’ve come into a great
fortune; but, whether you’re
rich or poor, that’s nothing to
me. I won’t marry you, ’cos
we’d be miserable; and that’s
what I come here all alone to-day
to say to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>“You are faithless, Annie!”</p>

<p>“No, sir; I’m faithful. As
for me, I’ll remember ye all
my days. P’rhaps I’ll marry,
p’rhaps I won’t; but I’ll never
forget <i>you</i>, and I’ll pray for you
every night.”</p>

<p>Bertram is touched and
astonished.</p>

<p>“But, my dear little girl,
you have my word of honour.
I can’t retract it. I will try
and make you happy, Annie.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you would try,
sir; but you couldn’t do it.
You’d make me miserable.
You haven’t any love for me;
you have said you hadn’t. I
couldn’t live like that. I’d
work on my knees for you all
the day long, but I couldn’t
stand your chilly pity and your
smiling scorn. I’d die of shame
and sorrow!”</p>

<p>“My poor child, you exaggerate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
immensely. You don’t
understand what sincere regard
I have for you, how honestly
I will try to do my duty by
you.”</p>

<p>“Sir, I ain’t more fit for
you than my poor sun-browned
throat be fit for a lady’s jewels.
You’ve had a hobby, and you’ve
rid it hard, and I was a part of
it for awhile. But ’twas only
a fancy. Lord! how clear I
saw it all when you spoke so
scornful-like o’ love! Love
may be a ordinary valleyless
sort o’ thing like buttercups
and daisies, but how them little
blossoms do make a glory on a
dusty common! It’s the buttercups
and daisies as I want, sir;
not them cold, white pearls.”</p>

<p>“Poor little Annie! I can’t
give you what I have not.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, that’s just it; the
fault ain’t none o’ yours. Don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
think as I blame ye, sir, or cast
a word against ye. We are as
we are made. But it is goodbye,
sir, and goodbye it must
be for ever. Don’t ye worry
or fret. ’Taint no fault o’
yours. We’re too wide apart,
and ’twas folly to think as we
could ever be one.”</p>

<p>Her voice breaks down, her
tears fall; Bertram takes her
hands in his and kisses her on
the forehead.</p>

<p>“Dear little Annie! I feel
as if I had sinned against you!
and yet God knows I had the
best intentions; and if I deceived
any one, I deceived myself
first of all.”</p>

<p>The tramp of heavy steps is
heard in the rooms beyond, and
Annie’s elder brother, Sam,
dashes the door-curtains aside
and enters, wildly flourishing a
driving-whip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>“Yah! Bloated aristocrat!
I’ve nabbed ye at last! Shame
on ye! Shame on ye, too,
Hann!” he yells at the top of
his voice. “Out o’ this room,
gal, whilst I gi’e your bloomin’
nob the lickin’ he deserves.
’Tis for this we pore workin’-folk
toils and moils and starves,
to hev our wimmen-kind trod
under foot like dirt by blackguard
swells! Sister Kate, at
’ome, says to me, ‘Sam, run
quick and ye’ll catch ’em together.’
And I meets yer servant
in the street, and he says, too,
‘Run, Sam, and ye’ll catch ’em
together.’ But I never thought,
respectable as our fam’ly is, and
so mealy-mouthed as is Sister
Hann——”</p>

<p>Bertram coldly interposes.</p>

<p>“When you have done yelling,
my good youth, will you listen
to a word of common sense?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>“Oh, Sam, are you mad?”
cries Annie. “Kate never
meant anything of the kind.
You know Mr. Bertram has
ever treated me as if I was a
waxworks under a glass case.”</p>

<p>“Take off your hat, put
down your whip, apologise to
your sister, and listen to me,”
says Bertram, with authority.</p>

<p>But the youth is in no
mood to hear or to obey. He
has taken a glass of gin with
a fellow-cabby, and his blood
is on fire.</p>

<p>“I won’t listen to you, nor
to nobody. Ye’ll get yer
thrashin’ at last, you scoundrel,
as preaches to the pore.”</p>

<p>He advances on Bertram,
whirling his horsewhip, with a
broken lash, above his head.
Bertram eyes him calmly, remembers
old Oxford rows,
straightens his arm, and meets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
him with a scientific blow which
sends him backward on the floor.</p>

<p>“Don’t scream, Annie. I
have not hurt your brother;
but he must have a lesson,” he
says, as he picked up the whip
which has dropped, breaks it,
in two, and throws the pieces
in a corner. “Get up, you
dolt, and ask your sister’s
pardon,” he adds, severely, “for
brawling in her presence.”</p>

<p>Sam Brown does get up,
stupidly and slowly, looks
around him bewildered, with a
dazed, blind look.</p>

<p>“You hits uncommon hard,”
he mutters, when he becomes
fully alive to the position
which he occupies.</p>

<p>“Certainly, I hit hard when
I hit at all. You insulted me
and, more gravely still, your
sister. I am perfectly ready to
marry her; but she will not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
marry me. Can you put that into
your brain and understand it?”</p>

<p>Sam stares and rubs his
aching head.</p>

<p>“Lord, sir, do you mean as
Hann hev jilted you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Sam, how can you!”
cries his sister.</p>

<p>“I believe that is what you
would call it in your world,”
says Bertram, with a slight
smile. “Your sister does not
wish to marry me. She thinks—perhaps
she is right—that
I am not worthy of her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Bertram! I
never——”</p>

<p>“She is my dear little friend,
Sam,” continues Bertram; “she
will always be my friend; and
if you presume to slight or
worry her in any kind of way,
you will have to deal with me.
You know now how I treat
affronts.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>The youth is still stupid and
ruefully rubbing his pate.</p>

<p>“Lawk a mussy! If you
would be spliced to her, she is
a darned fool.”</p>

<p>“She is a little sage and a
little saint. See her safe home,
and there are two sovereigns
to buy a new whip.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t take the money,
Sam!” cries Annie.</p>

<p>But Sam pockets the sovereigns.</p>

<p>“Strikes me, mister, you
owes me more than that,” he
mutters. “’Tis assault and
battery.”</p>

<p>“I shall give you no more
money,” says Bertram, very
decidedly. “I will knock you
down again if you like.”</p>

<p>“Come away, Sam,” says
Annie, pulling him towards
the door. “Oh Sam, aren’t
you ashamed?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>“Naw, I ain’t,” says her
brother. “Kate said, ‘Run
and you’ll find ’em together.’
I run and I did find ye together.
How was I to know?”</p>

<p>“Oh, come away, Sam,” repeats
his sister, in anguish.
“Come away. You disgrace
yourself and me. I’ll tell
mother.”</p>

<p>Sam is suddenly subdued and
greatly alarmed.</p>

<p>“Naw, don’t tell mother,”
he mutters, and suffers himself
to be led away.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so ashamed!
so ashamed, Mr. Bertram!” says
Annie. “Do pray forgive him.
He is only a lad.”</p>

<p>“I would forgive him much
heavier offences. He is your
brother.”</p>

<p>“God bless you, sir,” she says,
softly, looking back at him as
she goes out of the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>“Dear little girl! Dear,
honest little girl!” murmurs
Bertram. “I will try and get
her the kitchen, and the muffin,
and the cat, which form her
ideal, and some good fellow to
sit with her by the hearth.
Good Heavens! Can one ever
be grateful enough for being
saved from relationship to Sam?
What an exciting and exhausting
day! And I have been very
Philistine!”</p>

<p>He looks wearily round the
room; it has become shockingly
disordered; the drawers of the
cabinet are still on the floor;
the chairs which fell are still
upside down; the broken whip
lies in the corner; he is extremely
thirsty, and he has not
an idea where the mineral waters
or the syphon of seltzer, or
even the glasses, are kept. In
a single quarter of an hour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
without Critchett order and
harmony have been replaced by
chaos.</p>

<p>“What miserable, helpless
creatures we are!” he reflects.
“Of course it all comes from
the utterly false system of one
person leaning on others.”</p>

<p>Yet he reluctantly realises that
this false system has its merits,
as far as individual comfort goes.</p>

<p>At that moment there is a
sharp ring at the door-bell, and
a moment later still a male voice
cries:</p>

<p>“Can I come in, Bertram?”</p>

<p>“You, Stanhope?” says
Bertram, in extreme surprise.</p>

<p>“Myself,” replies the new-comer.</p>

<p>He is Sir Henry Stanhope,
the Home Secretary of the
actual Government. Bertram
was his fag at Eton, and a
good deal of cordial feeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
has always existed between
them, despite the vast and
irreconcilable difference of their
political and social opinions.
Sir Henry regards him as a
maniac, but an interesting and
lovable maniac. Bertram regards
him in return as a hopeless
Philistine, but a Philistine
who means well and has good
points, and who is, in the
exercise of his horrible office,
admirably conscientious. His
conscientiousness has not, however,
prevented him from allowing
to go to the gallows a victim
of prejudice who killed his wife
because he was tired of seeing
her red hair—a misguided
æsthete for whose release
Bertram pleaded in vain. Since
the time of this unfortunate
affair there has been some chillness
in the relations of Stanhope
and himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>The Philistine minister looks
at the disorder of the chamber
with some surprise, and seats
himself unbidden.</p>

<p>“My dear Bertram,” he says,
rather distantly, “old acquaintance
should not be forgot.
Its memories bring me here
to-day.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” says Bertram,
equally coldly; and looks an
interrogation.</p>

<p>Sir Henry coughs.</p>

<p>“You have a good many
<i>protégés</i> amongst the lower
classes, I think?”</p>

<p>“I deny that there is a lower
class.”</p>

<p>“I know you do. But let
us for the moment use the
language of a benighted and
unkind world. Your peculiar
views of duty have led you
into forming these associations
which cannot be agreeable to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
your taste. But did it not
occur to you that they might
be compromising as well as—as
rather unrefined?”</p>

<p>“Pray explain yourself,” says
Bertram, with hostility in his
tone.</p>

<p>Sir Henry feels nettled at
the manner in which his amiably
intended visit is received.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” he says. “In
two words, you have a friend
of the name of Hopper?”</p>

<p>Bertram colours.</p>

<p>“Frederic Hopper, yes. A
very unfortunate person, originally
a victim of the London
police.”</p>

<p>“Possibly. The police are
always accused of being oppressors
or accomplices,” continues
the minister. “This
person is known to them
as ‘Wet Whistle,’ because he
has exaggerated views of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
medicinal value of stimulants.
This victim came again in
collision with the brute force
of the police early this morning,
and you were present.”</p>

<p>Bertram is silent, conscious
that the episode is not heroic.</p>

<p>“Mr. Frederic Hopper does
not interest me in the least,”
says Stanhope, with culpable
heartlessness; “but it seems
you used very singular language
to the constables in the Park;
and when the man was brought
before the Westminster police-court
he gave your name as
that of the person who had
indoctrinated him with subversive
views, and it seems
that you admitted having done
so to the constables in Hyde
Park, and stated that you deserved
arrest more than did
this man Hopper. The police,
of course, reported all that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
said at headquarters; and you
are likely to be very seriously
annoyed about this matter. It
is very dangerous to play at
anarchism in these days——”</p>

<p>“If any one is to blame, it
is I rather than Hopper;
but there is no question of
anarchism.”</p>

<p>“I should certainly consider
you the more to blame of the
two. A magistrate would take
the same view. The Chief Commissioner
is of opinion that you
ought to have been arrested
with Hopper, since he places
all the blame of the subversive
principles which he had been
delivering in public upon
you.”</p>

<p>Bertram does not reply.</p>

<p>“He states that you had repeatedly
wanted him to place
explosives in public buildings,
and that you had promised him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
the run of the cellars of Buckingham
Palace, if he would
throw a hand grenade into the
royal carriage as the Queen
drives from Paddington Station
next Monday.”</p>

<p>Bertram smiles faintly.</p>

<p>“Are you sure that these
vivid romances are not composed
in Scotland Yard?”</p>

<p>Sir Henry is thoroughly
annoyed.</p>

<p>“No, sir. Scotland Yard
has too many real tragedies to
deal with to have time or patience
to compose mock melodramas.
The man Hopper
said this, and much more, inculpating
you as an anarchist.
All this might have passed
as a drunken ranter’s ravings,
but unfortunately there were
your published opinions in that
organ of yours, the <i>Age to
Come</i>. The magistrate, Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
Adeane, being acquainted with
these, thought the matter
serious enough to communicate
with me, whilst he committed
the fellow for seven days.
Mr. Adeane was justly of
opinion that if you will incite
persons to violent and nefarious
acts, your social rank and intellectual
culture ought not to
save you from punishment.”</p>

<p>“Certainly they ought not.”</p>

<p>“Then you do not admit
holding such opinions?”</p>

<p>“No; I am altogether opposed
to force; to force of
any kind.”</p>

<p>“Then your <i>protégé</i> lied?”</p>

<p>“If he used such expressions,
yes.”</p>

<p>“If! Do you suppose a
magistrate would send a deposition
which was never made
to the Home Office? I repeat
that what gave weight and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
credence to this wretched
agitator’s accusations of you
were the very—very—advanced
opinions acknowledged
and disseminated by you in
the <i>Age to Come</i>. Re-read for
yourself these passages,” continues
Stanhope, taking out
his note-book. “Page iv.
par. vi. No. 52; page iii. par.
xi. No. 23; page xix. par. ii.
No. 9; page viii. par. xv. No.
45—what is the meaning of
such phrases as these? ‘The
poor have always been robbed
by capital since the creation of
currency and the invention of
trade. All excesses are to be
excused to them in taking back
their own.’ Or this: ‘The rich
man, however estimable in private
character, is in position a
thief, and in conscience a scoundrel.’
Or this: ‘Poor-rates and
workhouses are the insult which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
is added to injury by the rich
in their relations with the poor.’
Or this: ‘Nitric acid destroys
more readily but not more
cruelly than taxation.’”</p>

<p>“Do you consider these
statements unjustified by the
state of society?” asks Bertram.</p>

<p>“I consider them most dangerous
when put before illiterate
persons,” replies Stanhope.
“The half-truths, or the quarter-truths,
which they contain,
are as poisonous as nux vomica.”</p>

<p>“Pray, then, let me go and
pick oakum with the unfortunate
man whom you consider
I have contaminated.”</p>

<p>Stanhope with difficulty keeps
down his rising anger.</p>

<p>“My dear Bertram, I regret
that you appreciate my intentions
so little. I received the
communication I speak of from
Mr. Adeane concerning you;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
and if I had done what I ought
I should perhaps have given
you some trouble. But I know
you; and I know that it is an
exaggerated altruism which runs
away with you into dangerous
places; and that you are the
last man in the world to inculcate
or to approve of crime.”</p>

<p>“But what <i>is</i> crime?” murmurs
Bertram. “Have not
regicides many apologists? Is
Carlyle alone in admiring Cromwell?
As boys are we not
adorers of Harmodius and
Aristogiton?”</p>

<p>“Fortunately,” continues Sir
Henry, waving aside these historical
precedents, “the magistrate
took a lenient view of
the case, considered it excused
by drink (we are always so immorally
lenient to drink in this
country!), and so I was enabled,
by using unacknowledged influence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
(a thing I loathe to do), to
get the affair hushed up. But
I cannot prevent your being
marked by the police and considered
a dangerous person.
You will probably be ‘shadowed’
for some time, and if
anything of this sort occurs
again it will be out of my power
to save you from exceedingly
disagreeable consequences.”</p>

<p>Bertram is silent.</p>

<p>“Are you anxious to be a
martyr in company with Hopper?”
asks Stanhope, with
impatience.</p>

<p>“If Hopper be made one,
certainly.”</p>

<p>Stanhope rises from his chair.</p>

<p>“I regret that I intervened
to screen you from the consequences
of your lubies. I
stretched my prerogative, and
risked the accusation of illegality
in my functions, in order to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
extricate you from the dilemma
in which your own imprudence
placed you, and this I did in
memory of old Eton days.
But I assure you that I shall
not interfere again, and I am
sorry that you so little appreciate
my friendship. Men in
office, it is true, should have no
personal feelings.”</p>

<p>“I am of course grateful for
your personal regard,” replies
Bertram, in icy tones, “but I
cannot allow any one to criticise
or control my opinions.”</p>

<p>Sir Henry does not deign to
reply. He takes his hat, and
with a curt “good-day” goes
out of the room.</p>

<p>“How impossible it is to live
under a government which is
utterly barbarian and unenlightened!”
reflects Bertram;
“and to think that Stanhope
could become a member of it!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
Such a fine scholar, such a devoted
Hellenist, as he was at
Eton! And now sunk to a
Home Secretary!—a keeper of
the ban-dogs of the law! It
is so extraordinary that these
Philistines never can comprehend
the beauty of altruistic
and collectivist views. They
always confound them with
anarchy! As if any two creeds
could possibly be more opposed.
It is extremely disagreeable all
the same. ‘Marked by the
police!’ as if I had broken
into a silversmith’s shop! I
wonder where Critchett kept
the mineral waters? I don’t
know where anything is. If I
had always served myself, how
much better it would have been.
It is so degrading this continual
dependence upon others. Every
kind of wrong-doing brings its
own chastisement, and our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
heresy and egotism in keeping
others in servitude is visited on
us by our own impotency to
help ourselves in the simplest
acts of daily life.”</p>

<p>Some one taps at the door
in the midst of his reflections.</p>

<p>“Come in!” he cried, irritably.
“Will annoyances never
cease?”</p>

<p>“It’s me, sir,” says Mrs.
Brown. “Please as how I’ve
come to bring you back these
two sovereigns as you gave my
son.”</p>

<p>“Why? I gave them willingly.”</p>

<p>“I can’t hev him paid for his
misbehaviour, sir, and he did
misbehave hisself. Kate spoke
in jest, and Sam, being tipsy,
took it in earnest.”</p>

<p>Bertram, fascinated by a
social problem, answers dreamily.
“Tell me, Mrs. Brown,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
your son attended a Board
School?”</p>

<p>“He did, sir.”</p>

<p>“And he passed the fourth
standard?”</p>

<p>“He did, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then, my good woman,
what benefit has that education
been to him?”</p>

<p>“Lord, none, sir; and nobbut
fools could ever suppose as ’twould
be any!” replies Mrs.
Brown, briskly.</p>

<p>“How very sad!” murmurs
Bertram. “But I have always
feared that the whole system
of modern education was one
gigantic error. You cannot
feed minds wholesale as you
feed machines.”</p>

<p>“’Tis sad as poor folks
should be made to pay for such
gammon as them schools, sir,”
says Mrs. Brown. “I beg
your pardon humbly for my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
boy’s misconduct, and you’ll
please take back the money.
As for the rest that Ann hev
told me I’ll make bold to say
as I ’eartily agree with it. You
know, Mr. Bertram, I never
could ’old with that pack o’
nonsense o’ your marriage with
my girl.”</p>

<p>“I know you never approved,
Mrs. Brown.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, ’cause I knows my
place. Lord, sir, ye’d hev been
miserable and my poor girl
too.”</p>

<p>“Not through any fault of
mine, Mrs. Brown.”</p>

<p>“No, sir; perhaps not. But
miserable ye’d both hev bin.
We’ll allus remember ye
kindly, sir, and I ’opes as ye’ll
still send us yer linen.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, certainly. I shall
always be your friend. Pray
take those sovereigns.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>“No, sir; let ’em lie. And
might I be so bold as to ask
hev ye took up your ’eritance,
sir?”</p>

<p>“My cousin’s fortune? No,
I have refused it.”</p>

<p>“Lord, sir! That’s a real
right-down pity.”</p>

<p>“I do not see it so, Mrs.
Brown.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, a gent as wears
such shirts as you shouldn’t
quarrel with his bread and
butter——”</p>

<p>A postman at that moment
comes through the antechamber
into the room, and tenders a
registered letter with the receipt
book for signature.</p>

<p>“What am I to do?” asks
Bertram, helplessly. “Critchett
has always seen to things of this
kind.”</p>

<p>“You’re to sign your name
in the book, sir,” says Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
Brown. He signs; and the
postman retires.</p>

<p>“I’ll leave ye to read your
letter, sir,” says Mrs. Brown;
“and if a poor woman may
give ye a word of advice, take
them cobwebs out of your brain,
sir, and open your eyes and see
the world as ’tis. That ere
man as ye thought so much on
was a raskill, as rotten as shellfish
o’ Saturday nights. Ye’ve
too good a ’eart, Mr. Bertram,
a deal too good a ’eart; and if
you make yourself honey flies
will eat yer; that’s true as
gospel, sir.”</p>

<p>“Wilfrid! Wilfrid!” shouts
an excited voice in the anteroom,
as a robust form and a
ruddy face, the face and form
of a country gentleman, are
visible in the distance.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown discreetly retires.</p>

<p>“My dear Wilfrid, is it possibly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
true what I heard in the
Marlborough this moment?”
cries Southwold, out of breath.
“Have you actually inherited
the whole fortune of those
Italian Erringtons, and have
never said a syllable about it to
your aunt and myself? It is
really—really—most extraordinary
conduct.”</p>

<p>“I do not see that the matter
concerns you,” says Bertram,
tranquilly.</p>

<p>“Not concern us?” repeats
Southwold, considerably astonished.
“Well, anything so
very fortunate occurring in my
wife’s family must concern every
member of it. I never knew
this young man, nor his father.
There was that unfortunate dissension
between your people
and his. But it is very consoling
that the grave has now
closed on all past feud; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
that the poor fellow did not
allow his father’s animosity to
alienate him from his kith and
kin. I really cannot congratulate
you sufficiently.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing to congratulate
me upon,” replies
Bertram, impatiently.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Nothing whatever.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because I decline the bequest.”</p>

<p>“Eh?”</p>

<p>“I decline the bequest.”</p>

<p>Lord Southwold pants like a
blown horse, his small blue eyes
grow large and black; his ruddy
face deepens to purple. “Good
God! You are mad as a hatter!”</p>

<p>“Are hatters less sane than
the rest of society? I am
incredulous of the possibility.”</p>

<p>“You can’t mean what you
say—you are joking!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>“I am entirely serious. And,
if you will allow me to say so,
you must be aware that the
matter does not, I repeat, in
the most remote manner concern
you.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord! Am I not
your aunt’s husband?”</p>

<p>“I have always heard so, and
Burke vouches for it.”</p>

<p>Southwold emits a strangled
sound that is an oath, a snarl,
and a groan in one.</p>

<p>“You ought to be placed in a
padded room, sir?” he says at
length, when he recovers his voice.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am never violent!”
says Bertram with a slight
smile, as he glances at the
pieces of the broken whip.</p>

<p>“Where do the money and
estates go?” roars Southwold.</p>

<p>“To a very respectable destination—Magdalen
College.”</p>

<p>“All of it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>“All of it.”</p>

<p>“Oh Lord!”</p>

<p>The unhappy gentleman,
gasping for breath, drops down
on a seat.</p>

<p>“With this fortune you could
marry Cicely Seymour! The
girl likes you—more fool she!”</p>

<p>Bertram changes colour.</p>

<p>“You have no right to speak
of that young lady: she is your
guest.”</p>

<p>Southwold becomes furious.</p>

<p>“You dare to lecture me?
You infernal ass! who are only
fit for a strait-waistcoat.”</p>

<p>Bertram shrugs his shoulders.</p>

<p>“You are stark staring
mad!” roars Southwold; “and
I tell you you are a disgrace to
your family.”</p>

<p>Bertram smiles.</p>

<p>“How extremely immoral,
then, to wish me to accept and
administer a great property.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>“Damnation!”</p>

<p>Southwold puts his hat on
his head, strikes his cane violently
on the back of a chair,
and rushes out of the room.</p>

<p>“What can it possibly matter
to him?” murmurs Bertram.
“The idea of money excites
some people as valerian does
cats.”</p>

<p>Lord Southwold, in a whirlwind
of disgust, walks as
rapidly as a gouty toe will
let him through the three or
four streets which divide him
from his own house in Berkeley
Square, and mounts the staircase
of his home with his wrath
at boiling-point. He goes into
his wife’s morning-room, where
she and Cicely Seymour are
sitting, one reading, the other
writing letters.</p>

<p>“It’s true!” he shouts. “It’s
perfectly true! it’s been left to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
him and he won’t have it—can
you believe that? he won’t have
it!”</p>

<p>Cicely looks up from her
book and says nothing; his
wife looks up from her writing-pad
and says with a sigh:</p>

<p>“I <i>can</i> believe it—<i>of him</i>.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t; though I’ve
heard him say it with my own
ears,” returns her lord, as he
drops down on a soft seat with
the air of a man crushed, annihilated,
effaced from creation.</p>

<p>“And he said, ‘What could
it possibly matter to us?’” he
added in a faint tone.</p>

<p>Cicely closes her book.</p>

<p>“Well, dear Lord Southwold,
why should it matter?”</p>

<p>“Why?” he ejaculates.
“Why?”</p>

<p>“Why?” repeats his wife.
“Oh, Cicely!”</p>

<p>“Well, why?” she says, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
little impatiently. “If Mr.
Bertram likes to live a poor
man instead of becoming a rich
one, what business is it of anybody’s?”</p>

<p>“Oh Lord!” sighs her host.</p>

<p>“Good heavens, Cicely!”
cries his wife. “You might
as well ask what does a man’s
suicide matter to his family?”</p>

<p>“Suicide is a disgrace, or at
least it is esteemed so. This is
an honour.”</p>

<p>“An honour!” echo both
her host and hostess in one
breath.</p>

<p>“A very rare honour,” she
replies, “to have a relative who
in these days has the courage
and loyalty to principle to refuse
a fortune.”</p>

<p>Southwold is too utterly
amazed and shocked to have
any power to answer her.</p>

<p>“My dear girl, this is very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
far-fetched,” says his wife.
“You are talking great nonsense,
and approving great folly.
I cannot believe that even my
nephew Wilfrid will be capable
of adhering to such a crazy and
thankless decision.”</p>

<p>“I am sure he will adhere
to it,” says Cicely Seymour,
warmly. “At least if he do
not I shall be very mistaken
in him. Do you think,”
she adds with indignation,
“that his principles are
mere sugared beignets, mere
frothy soufflées of eggs and
cream?”</p>

<p>“His principles!” cries
Southwold, with a snort like
an angry horse. “Do you
mean those preposterous tomfooleries
with which he entertained
us yesterday?”</p>

<p>“I mean the doctrines taught
in his own journal. He is an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
individualist, an altruist, a
collectivist, a Mazzïnist, a
Tolstoi-ist. How could such
a man with any consistency,
with any decency, accept a
great fortune?”</p>

<p>“My dear Cicely,” said Lady
Southwold, with unkind incisiveness.
“Only a great fortune
could get such opinions
forgiven to him; and as he
is going to marry a washerwoman’s
daughter, if what you
heard in the Park is true, he
will certainly never get her into
society on any income less than
thirty thousand a year!”</p>

<p>“He will not want to get
her into society. Nobody
gathers a dog-rose to put it
under a forcing-frame.”</p>

<p>“You are very epigrammatic,
my dear, but I am afraid you
have not much more common
sense than Wilfrid Bertram.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>“John,” she adds to her husband,
“do you think it would
be of any use if I went and
tried to persuade him to suspend
his decision?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it would be
the slightest,” replies her lord.
“But you might try. There
would be no harm in trying.
Tell him it’s flying in the face
of Providence.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid he doesn’t believe
in Providence!” says Lady
Southwold, with a sigh.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later she
returns to her morning-room
with a discouraged air, and
draws off her gloves.</p>

<p>“He was not at home,” she
says, in answer to her husband’s
look of interrogation. “The
door was shut, and his card was
stuck under the bell with ‘Out’
written upon it. I suppose I
could have done no good if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
I had seen him. For I met
Scott-Gwynne in the street,
and he told me he had just
heard Mr. Fanshawe saying in
the reading-room at the Travellers’
that Wilfrid had refused
formally, and signed his refusal.
Fanshawe was present.”</p>

<p>“But Mr. Fanshawe as a
Socialist, as a Radical, must
approve the refusal?” says
Cicely Seymour, from where
she sits by a stand of Malmaison
roses.</p>

<p>Southwold laughs grimly.</p>

<p>“Fanshawe thinks all wealth
should be equally distributed;
but so long as it isn’t so, he
gets all he can for himself, and
considers everybody should do
the same who has the opportunity.”</p>

<p>Cicely is silent.</p>

<p>“I suppose Wilfrid has gone
to have tea and shrimps with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
the washerwoman,” says Lady
Southwold. “Cicely, give me
some tea, please. I fear shrimps
are an unknown joy to us.”</p>

<p>Cicely rises and goes over to
the tea-table.</p>

<p>“Are you really positive that
he is going to marry this girl?”
asks his aunt, as Cicely hands
her a cup and some muffin.</p>

<p>“The mother of the girl said
so,” replies Cicely, coldly.
“She did not, herself, seem
to care about it.”</p>

<p>Lord Southwold laughs
savagely.</p>

<p>“To make a <i>mésalliance</i>, and
not even to be welcome! By
Jove! The fellow ought to
be shot. Disgracing both our
families in such a manner.”</p>

<p>“You are unfair to him,
Lord Southwold,” says Cicely.</p>

<p>“In what way, my dear?”</p>

<p>“You do not attempt to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
enter into his views, his
motives, his principles. His
opinions may be somewhat
exaggerated, but his loyalty to
them is none the less admirable.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you do admit they’re
exaggerated?”</p>

<p>“Some of them, yes. At
least, in the <i>Age to Come</i> there
are things which one cannot
wholly accept, but they always
err on the side of generosity!
And he is always consistent.
Mr. Fanshawe may be more
politic, but he is far less to be
respected. You blame the refusal
of this fortune. But you must
admit it shows his consistency.”</p>

<p>“Only fools are consistent,”
says Southwold, with unspeakable
contempt.</p>

<p>“Really,” cries Lady Southwold,
“one would think you
were in love with Wilfrid to
hear you, Cicely.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>Cicely colours a little.</p>

<p>“One is not necessarily in
love because one can see two
sides to a question. It seems
to me extremely unjust to
quarrel with anybody for
endeavouring loyally to carry
out the views which they
profess. You seem to admire
Mr. Fanshawe’s opportunism:
I do not.”</p>

<p>“Fanshawe is a shrewd man
of the world, Wilfrid is a
monomaniac who has gone daft
on altruism.”</p>

<p>“Or Annie-ism, as Lord
Marlow observed with such
exquisite wit,” says Cicely
from her retreat amongst the
roses, whither she has returned
after dispensing the tea.</p>

<p>A footman puts aside the
<i>portières</i> of one of the doors,
and announces:</p>

<p>“Mr. Bertram.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>There is a dead silence.</p>

<p>Lord and Lady Southwold
stare blankly at him.</p>

<p>Cicely rises from her bower
of roses and crosses the room
to him. She holds out her
hand with a charming smile.</p>

<p>“Let me congratulate you on
your marriage, Mr. Bertram,”
she says, in a very kind, sweet
voice.</p>

<p>Bertram looks at her with a
little embarrassment.</p>

<p>“It is very good of you,
Miss Seymour; you are the
only person who has said a
kind word——”</p>

<p>“A kind word! Can you
expect kind words?” begins
Southwold, in great ire.</p>

<p>“My dear Wilfrid, when
you afflict and disgrace us so,”
says his aunt.</p>

<p>Bertram silences them with
an impatient movement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>“Allow me to speak. My
marriage will not disgrace you,
for it will not take place——”</p>

<p>“Thank God!” cries Lady
Southwold.</p>

<p>“It is not I who have withdrawn.
It is—it is—Miss
Brown, with the consent of
her family. But I did not
come to speak of this matter,
which is one purely personal;
one with which I was not aware
you were acquainted. I came
to apologise to Lord Southwold
for my rudeness to him a little
while ago.”</p>

<p>“All right, all right,” replies
that choleraic but amiable
person. “I’m afraid I used
strong language myself; but
really your pig-headed illusions
are so uncommonly trying to a
plain, ordinary man like myself——”</p>

<p>“And you haven’t refused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
the inheritance, Wilfrid?” asks
his aunt, in great anxiety.</p>

<p>“I have refused, certainly,”
replies Bertram; “I have
signed and sealed refusal.”</p>

<p>Southwold emits a very
wicked word; his wife groans
aloud. Cicely Seymour, who
has gone back to the roses,
listens with a face grown bright
with interest and approval.</p>

<p>“Miss Seymour does not
blame me?” says Bertram,
softly.</p>

<p>“No; I should do as you
have done.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” says Bertram,
very gravely. Then he takes
a registered letter out of his
pocket.</p>

<p>“I have just received this,”
he continues. “Will you
allow me to read it to you?
It was sent to me by the poor
vicar of a village in the Pontine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
marshes, near which my cousin
met his death. He says that
my cousin dictated it as he lay
dying in his presbytery, and
the priest wrote it; it has been
sent to me through the Embassy
in Rome. Hence the delay.
To Folliott of course the man
of business had telegraphed.
The letter which he dictated
to this priest is, of course, in
Italian. I propose to translate
it to you, for I think my
uncle and you do not know
that language. It is very
short.”</p>

<p>He speaks to his aunt, but
he looks at Cicely Seymour.</p>

<p>“‘I am a dead man,’” he
reads aloud from the letter.
“‘An old tusker has let life
out of me for ever. You
will get this when I am
gone. I wish we had known
each other. I have left you all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
I possess, not because you are
a relative, but because I think
you will do good with it. I
have not been a student, but I
have seen some numbers of your
journal, and though I do not
agree with you in all your
opinions, I see you care for the
poor. Come and live on my
lands, and you’ll have work
enough cut out for you. I
have not done my duty—do
yours.’ It is signed by him,
and the signature is witnessed.”</p>

<p>They are all silent.</p>

<p>Lady Southwold has tears in
her eyes.</p>

<p>“There is a postscript,” continues
Bertram, “‘Take care
of my horses and dogs.’ The
priest adds that the poor fellow
had desired him to send it to
the English Embassy, and died
half an hour after dictating it.
That is all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>“It is very touching,” says
his aunt. “I wish we had
known him.”</p>

<p>“So do I.”</p>

<p>“A pity you did not get it
earlier,” says Southwold, “or
had not been so precipitate.”</p>

<p>Bertram folds the letter up
and looks across at the Malmaison
roses.</p>

<p>“Magdalen College,” adds
Southwold, grimly, “won’t
trouble itself much about the
horses and dogs.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you withdraw your
refusal, Wilfrid?” asks his
aunt.</p>

<p>Bertram is silent.</p>

<p>“Would they let you?”
asks Southwold.</p>

<p>“It is a cruel position to be
placed in,” says Bertram.</p>

<p>“Would it be utterly impossible,”
says Southwold, sarcastically,
“for you to regard it, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
a mere, humdrum, ordinary
Philistine person like myself
would do, as a very fortuitous
and felicitous piece of good
luck?”</p>

<p>“Good luck!” echoes Bertram,
in disgust. “Cannot you
see that whatever I do I must
feel humiliation and remorse;
that however I may decide, I
must feel that I leave some duty
undone?”</p>

<p>“No,” says Southwold, very
shortly, “I really cannot see
anything of the sort. But I
am obtuse, and I am very
commonplace.”</p>

<p>There is again a prolonged
silence.</p>

<p>It is broken by the low, clear
voice of Cicely Seymour, on
whose hair the last rays of the
dim red London sun are shining
in a nimbus.</p>

<p>“I understand what Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
Bertram feels. To accept this
fortune will be painful, and even
odious to him with his views.
But to let it go to others,
even to Oxford, must be,
after receiving this letter,
equally distressing to him because
he will feel that he has
failed to carry out a dead man’s
trust. Is not that your meaning,
Mr. Bertram?”</p>

<p>“It is.”</p>

<p>“These are very fine-drawn
sentiments, and they are, I confess,
wholly beyond me,” says
Southwold, with gruff contempt.</p>

<p>“I know what they both
mean,” says his wife. “But to
me too it is, I admit, rather
far-fetched. It seems to me so
easy and so simple to go back
to Folliott and Hake and say,
‘I have changed my mind; I
accept.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>“But would it be right to do
so?” says Bertram. “How
can I be sure that the foul fiend
of selfishness is not deluding me
by taking the shape of duty?”</p>

<p>“You split straws!” growls
Southwold. “The business of
the world would never get
done if men hemmed and
hawed and tortured themselves
as you do. <i>Can</i> you retract
your refusal? That’s the main
question.”</p>

<p>“I can. Folliott said that
they should take no action on
it for twenty-four hours, but
hold it in abeyance for that
term. Fanshawe suggested
that, indeed insisted on it.”</p>

<p>“Fortunate for you that a
practical man was with you. I
have a respect for Mr. Fanshawe
which I did not feel before.
Well, my dear Wilfrid,
you can’t hesitate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>Bertram does hesitate.</p>

<p>He looks across at the roses.</p>

<p>“Will you decide for me,
Miss Seymour?”</p>

<p>“It is a great responsibility,”
she replies, and her colour rises.</p>

<p>She plays with one of the
roses nervously for a few moments.
At last she looks up
and says gravely:</p>

<p>“I think you should accept,
Mr. Bertram. To you such
wealth would be no sinecure, but
always regarded as a great trust
to be employed for the welfare
of others.”</p>

<p>Bertram bends his head.</p>

<p>“Since you think so, I will
endeavour to merit your opinion
of me.”</p>

<p>“And if you go and live on
the Italian lands you can be as
self-sacrificing and as wretched
as you like,” adds Southwold,
gleefully. “Mosquitoes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
malaria, malandrini, and the
hourly probability of a shot
from behind a hedge, or a
dagger-thrust from an irate
beggar, will certainly provide
you with constant material for
the most active altruism.”</p>

<p>“Of course he will be in
England half the time; there
is a great deal of the Errington
property in England,” says
Lady Southwold, before whose
mental vision many charming
prospects are dancing; and she
rises and goes across to Cicely
Seymour and kisses her on her
sun-illumined hair.</p>

<p>“You will always give Wilfrid
good counsel, won’t you
darling?” she says, very tenderly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bertram will want no
counsel but his own conscience,”
says Cicely Seymour, with the
colour in her cheeks. “Oh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
Lord Southwold, conscience is
so rare in our days, it seems almost
dead; you should not
laugh at those who through all
mockery try to keep alive its
sacred flame!”</p>

<p>“Since Wilfrid has your
esteem, my dear, I laugh at
him no longer,” says Southwold,
with pleasant malice. “I
am thoroughly convinced that
he is the wisest, and will be the
happiest, of men.”</p>
